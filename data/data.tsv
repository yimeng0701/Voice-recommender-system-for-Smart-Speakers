Baseball	Five Minnesota pitchers combined to stop Cleveland's offense and the Twins widened their lead in the AL Central by defeating the Indians 2-0 in the first game of Saturday's day-night doubleheader.The Twins were forced to go with a bullpen game in both ends of the doubleheader after Friday night's game was postponed by rain in the third inning.That strategy worked to perfection in the opener of the showdown series, and Minnesota leads Cleveland by 4 1/2 games.
Baseball	"Baltimore beat Detroit in the opener of the battle of the bad.In the first meeting in 50 years of major league teams both 50 or more games under .500, DJ Stewart and Trey Mancini homered to lead the Orioles over the Tigers 6-2 on Friday night.""I think we can all look in the mirror at night and be proud of ourselves in the effort that we give,"" Mancini said. ""It doesn't always translate into wins, but we all have so much to play for still, and we want to go out and win every game.""This was just the fourth time teams 50 or more games under .500 met, according to STATS, the first since Montreal played at San Diego on Aug. 29, 1969. The others were between Kansas City and Washington on Oct. 7, 1886, and between St. Louis and Louisville on Sept. 13, 1886, STATS said.In a match impacting primarily which team will pick first in next June's amateur draft, Detroit dropped to a big league-worst 43-103, its most losses since setting a team mark at 43-119 in 2003.Baltimore, last in the AL East at 48-99, avoided for a night ensuring its second straight 100-loss season after going 47-115 last year.Baltimore and Detroit set a record for combined losses entering an AL series at 201."
Baseball	"Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona had the perfect description for Wednesday night's 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels when he said ""we pieced it together.""Carlos Santana and Francisco Lindor homered while Carlos Carrasco won in relief as six Cleveland relievers allowed only one run over the final 4 2/3 innings.""There was a lot going on but we did a real good job,"" Francona said.The Indians went 5-1 on their road trip against Minnesota and Los Angeles and are half-game behind Oakland for the second AL wild-card spot. They trail wild-card leader Tampa Bay by one game.Cleveland is within four games of Minnesota in the AL Central heading into a three-game series at home against the Twins this weekend."
Baseball	Castellanos -- who openly complained about Comerica Park's spacious dimensions earlier this year when he was with Detroit -- has flourished since a trade to the Chicago Cubs. The 27-year-old outfielder has hit 13 home runs for Chicago in 35 games. That's two more than he hit in 100 games this season for the Tigers.Castellanos has hit six home runs at Wrigley Field after hitting only three at Comerica this year.Castellanos could be crucial for the Cubs down the stretch. They dropped the final three games of a series against Milwaukee and lead the Brewers by just two games for the second wild card in the National League. Philadelphia is also two back, and surging Arizona is 1+ behind after winning 11 of 13.Chicago has injury problems. Shortstop Javier Baez is dealing with left thumb issues, and closer Craig Kimbrel has had elbow inflammation. If the Cubs do make the postseason, they can thank Castellanos.Not every big trade at the deadline has paid dividends. Marcus Stroman has a 5.05 ERA in seven starts for the New York Mets. Yasiel Puig has only two home runs in 33 games for Cleveland. Zack Greinke is 4-1 for Houston, but he's posted a 3.86 ERA since being traded to the Astros and hasn't really been dominant.Castellanos is the acquisition who has really made a difference. He's hit .338 for the Cubs with an OPS of 1.056.
Baseball	"Joey Votto turned 36 years old earlier this week and has battled a bad back that sent him to the injured list for a decent chunk of August.But if age is starting to catch up with him, it's hard to tell.Votto and Josh VanMeter both hit two-run homers, Luis Castillo pitched five solid innings and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 on Friday night.""He's done it his whole career,"" Cincinnati Reds manager David Bell said of Votto. ""He's always working on it, trying to improve and making adjustments. He's in a good place. It'd be great to have him finish strong and take it into next year.""The Diamondbacks lost their sixth straight to tumble further out of the NL wild card race. They won 11 out of 12 from Aug. 25-Sept. 7 to pull within 1 1/2 games of the second wild card spot, but are now 4 1/2 behind the Chicago Cubs with just 14 to play."
Baseball	Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman left the Braves' game against the Washington Nationals in the fourth inning Friday night because of right elbow soreness.The team said the move was precautionary.Freeman's spot in order did not come up in the top of the fourth. and Charlie Culberson replaced him at first base in the bottom of the inning. Freeman flied to right in the first and struck out swinging in the third against Max Scherzer.
Baseball	"If this was Chris Paddack's final start of 2019, he will have finished his rookie season with a brilliant performance that hurt the Chicago Cubs in their pursuit of a wild-card spot.Paddack pitched six strong innings and the San Diego Padres beat the Cubs 4-0 Wednesday night, dropping Chicago into a tie with Milwaukee for the second NL wild-card spot. Manuel Margot homered off San Diegan Cole Hamels and also made a spectacular catch in center field.""That's something I took into my start today, making stuff personal,"" the 23-year-old Paddack said. ""They're not going to get a wild-card run if we can't. That's just basically what I told myself.""The Cubs lost for the second straight night and for the fifth time in six games. Milwaukee beat Miami 7-5 in its first game since reigning MVP Christian Yelich suffered a season-ending knee injury. Philadelphia and the New York Mets are two games behind the Cubs and Brewers.Hamels (7-7) didn't get out of the fifth. The left-hander, who went to Rancho Bernardo High, allowed one run on four hits, struck out six and walked four in 4 1/3 innings."
Baseball	"Day game after a night game ... but the Milwaukee Brewers -- who have won six games in a row -- can't afford to take a break.The Brewers, engaged in a tough fight for a National League playoff berth, will go for a four-game sweep of their series against the host Miami Marlins on Thursday afternoon.Milwaukee lost star right fielder Christian Yelich for the rest of the season due to a fractured kneecap on Tuesday, putting even more pressure on other hitters such as center fielder Lorenzo Cain, third baseman Mike Moustakas, catcher Yasmani Grandal and left fielder Ryan Braun.Cain, for example, could use a rest on Thursday as he has been playing with a bruised left knee. But with Milwaukee's situation in the standings, he has continued to play.""It's still painful to run, but I'm moving better than I was three or four days ago,"" Cain said. ""My knee is not giving out on me right now."""
Baseball	Two young sluggers who are considered pillars in the Chicago White Sox rebuilding plan came through with impressive drives on the same night.Eloy Jimenez hit his first career grand slam, Yoan Moncada launched a monster two-run homer and the White Sox beat the Kansas City Royals 7-3 on Tuesday night.Adam Engel added a solo shot for as the White Sox won their second straight, but just their fourth in 14 games.The White Sox expect Jimenez and Moncada to play prominent long-term roles as the team reshapes itself into a contender after a lengthy drought. Jimenez thinks their power show could continue for years.
Baseball	Outfielder Mike Tauchman became the New York Yankees' 30th player on the injured list this year, the most in the major leagues in at least 15 years.The 28-year-old strained his left calf Sunday and is expected to miss the rest of the season. New York made the roster move retroactive to MondayAcquired from Colorado on March 23, Tauchman hit .277 with 13 homers in 260 at-bats over 87 games. He is New York's 15th player currently on the IL.Major League Baseball said the Yankees' total on the injured/disabled list is the most since at least 2004, topping the 28 for the Los Angeles Dodgers in both 2016 and 2017. Boston had 27 in 2012.
Baseball	Leading off as the designated hitter in Friday's contest against the AL East-leading New York Yankees, Bichette went 3-for-5, logging an all-important walk-off home run in the 12th. Bichette, at 21 years and 192 days old, became the youngest Blue Jay in franchise history to hit a walk-off homer, and he apparently felt it coming.Prior to the at-bat, Bichette reportedly told teammate Charlie Montoyo that he felt good about his chances going against a lefty.It was Zombie Night at the Rogers Centre and, fittingly, it took multiple spurts of life for the Blue Jays to come out on top.Leading 3-0 through the first four innings, Toronto had control. But the Yankees took the lead and all of the momentum with a five-run top of the fifth.This killed the Blue Jays   for the time being.After responding with only a single run in the fifth, the Blue Jays still trailed, but only until the seventh inning when they knotted the game up at 5-all. Working Richard Urena around the bases took just about every tool available: a single, a walk, a fielder's choice and a sacrifice fly brought in the tying run.The Jays then had an opportunity to end the game in the ninth with Bichette standing on third, but were unable to finish.In extra innings, the Blue Jays came back to life.Three pitches into the at-bat, Bichette launches one estimated at 390 feet over the center-field wall.
Baseball	Corey Kluber is injured, Carlos Carrasco continues to work his way back from leukemia treatment and Trevor Bauer was traded, and still the Cleveland Indians continue to get solid pitching.Rookie Zach Plesac threw a four-hitter for his first complete game in the majors as the Indians kept pace in the AL playoff race, blanking the Los Angeles Angels 8-0 Tuesday night.The right-hander is the fifth Cleveland pitcher to toss a shutout this season, which leads the majors. He struck out five and walked two while throwing 114 pitches.
Basketball	Anthony Davis is already one of the world s most devastating players from inside the arc. Now the six-time all-star has locked his focus onto becoming an outside threat.Davis   who scored more points in the paint last season (14.3) than anybody other than MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo (17.5)   said during a Twitter Q&A for NBA 2K that his greatest offseason emphasis has been 3-point shooting. This summer I improved the most on my 3-ball. I wanted to be able to stretch the floor,  Davis said.  As a big, the game is definitely going that way now.   I for sure want to get that [percentage] in the high 30s. By me doing that I ll be able to help the Lakers as much as possible   and hopefully win a championship.
Basketball	Will Stephen Curry s efficiency force a broader acceptance of advanced statistics? Even for people who don t follow the numbers behind the sport with a keen eye, it s hard to not to do a double take when shown the graphic. Curry s 386 three pointers vaulted him over previous record holder, Ray Allen on Saturday.It s a different era for sure, but even given the systemic changes we ve seen to basketball recently (changes that Curry is at least partially responsible for) this is still an impressive feat - and even more impressive given that he did it in nearly half as many games.
Basketball	Monroe has appeared in 40 games this season (two starts) with Toronto and Boston, averaging 4.7 points and 4.0 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game.Currently in his ninth NBA season, Monroe has seen action in 629 career games (417 starts) with Detroit, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Boston and Toronto. He holds lifetime averages of 13.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals in 27.7 minutes per game. A career .513 shooter from the field, Monroe has shot at least .500 in five of his nine NBA seasons, including a career-high .565 in 2017-18. He is one of 25 active players with 200-or-more double-doubles.Originally selected by Detroit with the No. 7 overall selection in the 2010 NBA Draft, Monroe played two collegiate seasons at Georgetown. He led the 2009-10 Hoyas to a 23-11 record and No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, while averaging 16.1 points and a team-best 9.6 rebounds per game.
Basketball	Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers has been named the Western Conference Player of the Week, according to NBA.com. It is the first time this season Lillard has received the honor, and it is the seventh time in his career. His performances against the Nets, Hawks, and Pistons garnered the award for the week ending March 31.With 31 points and 12 assists in a double-overtime victory over the Nets on March 25, Lillard recorded his 20th career game of at least 30 points and 10 assists, passing Clyde Drexler for the most such games in franchise history (19). Lillard netted 36 points (13-25 FG, 4-10 3-PT, 6-6 FT), including 18 points in the first quarter, at Atlanta on March 29, leading Portland to its season-high sixth straight win. It was the 26th time this season that Lillard scored at least 30 points.
Basketball	The Los Angeles Lakers have signed guard Demetrius Jackson, it was announced today. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released.Drafted 45th overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, Jackson averaged 3.7 points and 6.5 minutes in six games for Philadelphia last season. The Notre Dame alum, who also spent time with the Celtics and Rockets, averaged 19.4 points, 7.4 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 1.1 steals in eight games last season for the Delaware Blue Coats of the NBA G League.
Basketball	No one on Spain s basketball team is looking past Sunday s World Cup final.Certainly not Marc Gasol, who scored 33 points to lead the Spanish over Australia 95-88 in double overtime on Friday in the semifinals. Ricky Rubio scored 19 points and Sergio Llull added 17.Spain will next face Argentina, which defeated France 80-66 in the other semifinal game.Gasol won the NBA title a few months ago with the Toronto Raptors. And now he can do the double by winning with Spain, which won this title 13 years ago when it was called the world championship.
Basketball	Livingston won three championships with the Warriors and played 15 seasons in the NBA after being the No. 4 overall pick of the 2004 draft by the LA Clippers. His career was marked by his valuable backup role with the Warriors as well as a gruesome knee injury he suffered in the 2006-07 season against the Charlotte Hornets. It took Livingston nearly two years to return to an NBA court, but he did, playing four games for the Miami Heat in the 2008-09 season. From there, he became a valuable backup guard, spending time with the Oklahoma City Thunder (2008-09), Washington Wizards (2009-10), Charlotte Bobcats (2010-11), Milwaukee Bucks (2011-12), Washington Wizards and Cleveland Cavaliers (2012-13) before signing with Golden State in the summer of 2014.He is just the second player in NBA history to complete a tenure of at least five seasons with a team having made an NBA Finals appearance in each season, joining Tom Heinsohn, who did so in all nine of his seasons with the Boston Celtics from 1956-65. In his career, Livingston averaged 6.3 points, 3 assists and 2.4 rebounds per game over 833 career games. He was waived by the Warriors in early July.
Basketball	The No. 7 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft just enjoyed his best season as a pro, averaging 18.2 points, 4.8 assists, and 4.2 rebounds in 32.6 minutes per game.In the playoffs, Murray averaged 21.7 points and 4.7 assists per game while leading Denver to Game 7 in the Western Conference Semifinals before bowing out to the Trail Blazers.Now, Murray and Nuggets will return most of their roster and be a strong NBA Finals contender in the Western Conference.
Basketball	Nearly a week after Morey s radio appearance, Houston s ideal third star has been identified. It s Jimmy Butler, the same player the Rockets had a chance to acquire from the Timberwolves in November, but couldn t complete the deal. Minnesota, as you know, went on to deal Butler to Philadelphia for a package headlined by Robert Covington and Dario Saric.Morey is now attempting to atone for that misstep by forcing a sign-and-trade for Butler just as he enters free agency in a landscape that could feature 10 teams with max cap space. It s ballsy and will take some serious cap gymnastics, but it sounds like Morey and Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta are on the same page, for better or worse.
Basketball	T he Milwaukee Bucks announced that guard Malcolm Brogdon will be out for at least Games 1 and 2 of their Eastern Conference second round series against the Boston Celtics. Brogdon hasn t played since March 15th, when he suffered a partially torn plantar fascia in his right foot. The hope for Milwaukee was that Brogdon would return in time to start the second round, but the team now says he won t be re-evaluated until after Game 2.Brogdon started all 64 games he played for the Bucks and turned in the best season of his career. The 2017 NBA Rookie of the Year averaged 15.6 points, 3.2 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game. But what made Brodgon s year special was that he joined the exclusive 50/40/90 club for players who shoot at least 50% from the floor overall, 40% on three-pointers and 90% at the free throw line. Brogdon shot 50.5% overall, 42.6% from behind the arc and and NBA-leading 92.8% at the charity stripe. All three of those figures were career-highs.
Basketball	After scoring 30 points that felt like 40 in Game 1, Damian Lillard put up 29 points in Game 2 of Portland s first-round series against Oklahoma City. Each one of his buckets felt like a dagger to the heart. In propelling Portland to a 2-0 series lead, they may have also been a dagger to the Thunder s playoff hopes.On one play, Lillard made a meme out of Raymond Felton, turning him around with a nasty crossover before ending the third quarter at the buzzer with a step-back three.In a series where the Thunder have a both triple-double machine and a dual candidate for both MVP and Defensive Player of the year, the Trail Blazers have the difference maker.
Basketball	The Sixers have received plenty of bad news recently with the aggravation of a left knee injury to their superstar Joel Embiid. This time they get a bit of good news. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium, James Ennis is available to play tonight in game 2 against the Brooklyn Nets. Trailing 1-0 in the best of 7 game series, the Sixers  rotation was already dangerously thin. It didn t help when Ennis injured his quad with a contusion weeks ago. To make matters worse he aggravated the injury and missed even more time. But the perimeter player acquired in a trade around the deadline from the Houston Rockets might be able to provide a spark off the bench.Ennis won the  quiet tournament  head coach Brett Brown discusses occasionally. Coach Brown wanted to see who would be the most reliable among Ennis, Jonathon Simmons and Furkan Korkmaz. Ennis won that fight for minutes and a playoff rotation handily as he is the only one of the three who can reliably help on both ends of the floor.
Canadian National	"Trump stunned the world when he swept into office in 2016. From the beginning, Canadians wanted to know if Trudeau could assert himself with this brash real estate developer, a man who had called Mexicans rapists, bragged about grabbing women by the genitals and called for a travel ban on Muslims before getting elected.Trudeau visited Trump at the White House in early 2017 and the two ""affirmed their longstanding commitment to close co-operation"" in a statement. But then Trump, who had already called NAFTA “the worst trade deal in history” on the campaign trail, ordered his administration to move forward with renegotiations. The U.S. issued big demands later in 2017, setting up Trudeau to declare he was “pushing back” a few months later, a move that was followed by the U.S. slapping tariffs on metals exports.By the time Trudeau hosted Trump and other G7 leaders in Quebec in June 2018, the trade dispute was starting to turn nasty. Trump blew up the summit in a tweet after jetting off early, insulting the prime minister from Air Force One as a “dishonest” and “weak” man for the crime of standing up against the tariffs."
Canadian National	An Ipsos poll released in May, 2019 found 37% of Canadians believe immigration is a “threat” to white Canadians, while 53% disagreed.Some polls suggest Conservative voters and those with less education take the hardest line on immigration and refugee issues, but one caution here is that answers to polls depend on what questions are asked.An Environics poll released in April, 2019 found much more positive attitudes, including that 59% disagreed with the statement, “overall there is too much immigration in Canada” while 77% agreed, “overall, immigration has a positive impact on the economy of Canada.”However, what these polls show collectively is that Canadians have serious concerns about Trudeau’s immigration and refugee policies.This despite the fact Trudeau and Co. have essentially argued for four years that any response other than support for ever-increasing immigration levels is at best uninformed and at worst, racist, which is utterly absurd.
Canadian National, International	The Liberals are boasting that they stood up to U.S. President Donald Trump in new television ads released Saturday, touting a North American free trade deal that remains in limbo, as a multinational chief executive took credit for a breakthrough in the talks.Stephen Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, has penned a book in which he says he brokered a deal between Trudeau and Trump that saw the Canadian prime minister make concessions on dairy, according to a report in The Globe and Mail about the book, to be published next week.Schwarzman claims that Trump had refused to meet with Trudeau while they were both at the UN in New York in September 2018, ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline, and that Trudeau asked him to intervene as NAFTA talks had stalled.The Globe quotes Schwarzman as writing about how he told Trudeau to “empty your pockets on dairy.”“I told him I did deals for a living and the moment had come to stop agonizing. If he refused to meet the U.S. demands of a deal, Canada would almost certainly go into a recession, and no politician wins re-election in a recession. If he did a deal, at least he’d have a chance of political survival,” Mr. Schwarzman writes.“Empty your pockets on dairy. Make any last concessions you can and draw the line on Chapter 19 [a dispute-resolution mechanism] and the cultural exemption, the law protecting Canadian media from foreign ownership, if you have to. Move the lingering secondary issues to the bottom of the page and state simply what you are or are not prepared to do about them. Send the documents to the administration and walk away,” Schwarzman writes, according to Globe quotes from the book.If Schwarzman’s account is accurate, the book undermines the claim that Chrystia Freeland, the foreign affairs minister who led the negotiations, and Trudeau crafted a deal through canny negotiations.Freeland is the narrator of ads that the Liberal Party released Saturday morning which attempt to capitalize on the credibility she gained through the tough 14-months of talks that ended last year.
Canadian National	On the second day of his re-election campaign, Justin Trudeau went to Alberta.It's something of a tradition now. Trudeau went to Alberta on the second day of his campaign for the Liberal leadership in 2012, and went back on the second day of the federal election in 2015.As prime minister, he has made nearly two dozen trips to the province. His most recent visit was in July, when he dropped by the Edmonton terminal of the Trans Mountain pipeline — the pipeline his government bought for $4.5 billion in 2018 so that a multi-billion-dollar expansion project could proceed.If he makes a point of going there, it's not because Albertans are particularly keen to see him, or because a Liberal majority hinges on winning a significant number of the province's 34 seats. Matching the four seats the Liberals won in 2015 would be considered an achievement for the party. Current projections say the Liberals would be lucky to retain even a single seat in the province.But for Trudeau, Alberta still looms large — and keeping two or three seats there might mean more than just a slightly larger parliamentary caucus.
Canadian National	"In Trudeau's own estimation, his father's political legacy cast its largest and darkest shadow in two provinces: Quebec and Alberta. In Quebec, he has largely slain the beast — the Liberals won 40 seats there in 2015 and could win 50 this time.In Alberta, the stigma persists. And not even the purchase of a pipeline has done much to shake the majority view there that Justin Trudeau, like his father, is one of those ""eastern bastards"" who feels a callous disregard for the West and its resources.But Trudeau also has said that he can't claim to be a prime minister for all Canadians and a leader who listens if he doesn't spend time in Alberta — that doing so is part of the work of holding the country together.And the province isn't quite the electoral wasteland for Liberals it's sometimes alleged to be. The party still has hopes of retaining at least a few of the four seats it won in Alberta four years ago. On Thursday evening, Trudeau was in the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona, where the NDP incumbent, Linda Duncan, is not seeking re-election."
Canadian National	"Millennials may be known for their expensive lattes and avocado toast, but will they have an appetite for politics in the federal election this fall? It's a question that could have a major impact on the outcome.Specific definitions of this generation vary, but Canadians between the ages of 18 and 38 will make up as much as 37 per cent of the electorate in this federal election, according to Abacus Data. That means the outcome could be decided by millennials if they collectively put their support behind a particular political party. In the 2015 federal election, Elections Canada estimated about 57 per cent of the population from ages 18 to 34 cast ballots, up from 42.5 per cent in 2011. The surge in the millennial vote was largely credited to helping the Liberals win a majority government. This time around, all party leaders are paying close attention to the millennial vote as they prepare to unveil their platforms.At his campaign launch on Wednesday, for example, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau spoke about his party's work on protecting the environment and ensuring prosperity for all Canadians, including millennials. ""These are the things that young Canadians expect, indeed, that all Canadians expect,"" Trudeau said. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is expected to unveil a housing policy aimed at millennials.NDP leader Jagmeet Singh is planning to address concerns from young people about the climate crisis. And the Greens have promised to eliminate tuition for post-secondary students."
Canadian National	"Green Party Leader Elizabeth May doesn't much like politics. She says, in fact, that there are many other jobs she'd rather have.So why does she stay in it?""Because I have to save the whole world and we're running out of time,"" she told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos over lunch last week. ""I loved practising law when I practised law. But I think my job would be the one I was on a path to do before I got involved in politics, which is to be an Anglican priest.""May has been at the helm of the federal Greens since 2006, and was elected to the House of Commons in 2011."
Canadian National	When Trudeau was first elected, an NDP government was in power in the country’s largest oil-producing region in Alberta, while a Liberal government was in charge in Canada’s most populous province, Ontario. Since then, a wave of Tory blue has swept across the country frustrating the prime minister’s attempts to align with the provinces and achieve his political goals.In 2016, Brian Pallister’s Progressive Conservatives in Manitoba ended almost two decades of NDP government there. In June 2018, Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives were elected in Ontario, setting up the first right-of-centre government in the province since the early 2000s. That was followed by Quebec Premier François Legault’s right-leaning Coalition Avenir Québec winning in October 2018. Also that year, in New Brunswick, Blaine Higgs’ Progressive Conservatives were sworn in after defeating the Liberal government in a non-confidence vote.This spring, Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party swept to power in Alberta, while Dennis King’s Progressive Conservatives have come to power in Prince Edward Island. Meanwhile, Pallister has just successfully held on to his Tory government in Manitoba.Many of the true-blue premiers are fighting Trudeau over a law requiring them his attempt to put a price on pollution, and have created a very different political landscape for the federal election.
Canadian National	Here are some useful definitions of terms you'll come across in election coverage.Advance polls — During specific times and days before election day, polls are opened for people who want to vote early. The ballots are not counted until election day.Attack ad — A negative ad that criticizes a political candidate. These ads are paid for by opposing political parties, or by third-party groups. Ballot — The piece of paper on which electors mark a vote for a candidate. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order on the ballot. The ballot also includes information about each candidate's political party, or if the candidate has registered as an independent. See also: special ballot.Canada Elections Act — The law that regulates federal elections. Commissioner of Canada Elections — An independent officer who investigates violations of the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act. The commissioner is independent of Elections Canada, however the commissioner is appointed to a 10-year term by the Chief Electoral Officer. The commissioner can't have been a candidate or have worked for a political party, either as an employee or contractor. Chief electoral officer — Person responsible for overseeing federal elections in Canada. This person is considered an independent agent of Parliament. Debate consortium — A group of broadcasters that agree to work together to broadcast and livestream debates between political leaders. The consortium negotiates the terms of the debates with political parties. Debates commissioner — For 2019, there is a Leaders' Debates Commission, established by the federal government, that will plan and hold two leaders debates, one in English and one in French, in early to mid-October. It is worth noting the commission will contract an organization, or a group of organizations to plan and run the debates.
Canadian National	With Canada’s 2019 federal election campaign officially underway, now is not the time to extinguish the climate debate—it’s time to ramp it up. A recent Globe and Mail opinion disparaged the emphasis on climate rhetoric as the upcoming election approaches. The contention between the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties’ environmental platforms has led critics to condemn the fierce disagreement as diversion from traditional political civility. But political civility doesn’t achieve anything in the fight against the climate crisis. We don’t need compromise to reduce Canada’s carbon emissions and reach our 2015 Paris Agreement targets—we need bold, radical action.  If anything, when it comes to climate policy, the division between Canada’s four main parties is not distinct enough. The Liberals champion carbon pricing, but Prime Minister Trudeau’s government purchased the controversial Trans Mountain Pipeline. Green Party leader Elizabeth May is calling for Canada to move away from foreign oil (and oil in general), but is content to supplement that with the Alberta oil industry in the meantime.
Canadian National	"Poverty rates in Canada have fallen since the Liberals were elected, but by how much?As part of our federal election coverage, CBC News is assessing the truthfulness and accuracy of statements made by politicians and their parties.The Claim: ""Nine hundred thousand Canadians have been lifted out of poverty, including 300,000 children.""— Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on his commitment to ""people working hard to join"" the middle class."
Canadian National	The federal election is officially underway, and that means more Canadians will be moving online to discuss, debate and prepare for the vote.But they'll be stepping into an environment that's been embroiled in the campaign for months, with messaging that ranges from disinformation to good old-fashioned politicking.Here's a look at some of the major players online, the kind of messages they're sharing and what voters can expect online over the next five weeks.
Canadian National	During the 2015 federal election, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau coasted to victory in part thanks to Indigenous voters determined to evict former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from office.Lori Campbell, a two-spirit Cree-Métis woman from the Sixties Scoop generation who is the director of the Shatitsirótha’ Waterloo Indigenous Student Centre at St. Paul’s University College, was one of many drawn in by Trudeau’s sunny ways.And yet, she says, the last four years have been something beyond disheartening.“It’s another one of those things that happen to people who don’t usually have a voice,” Campbell says.It was not one moment, she says, but a series of moments — including the issues that plagued the MMIWG inquiry — that solidified in 2018 when Trudeau’s government bought a pipeline for $4.5 billion and then defended his government’s environmental record.
Canadian National	“I’m afraid we will lose some Indigenous people, Indigenous voices that voted last time because of that and I think that’s a shame,” Campbell says.It’s part of the reason she’s tossed her hat in the ring this election — Campbell is running as the NDP candidate in Waterloo and is not the only Indigenous person to cite Trudeau’s leadership failures as a reason to run.Guy Gallant, a campaign spokesperson for Trudeau, said the the Liberals believe Canada’s most important relationship is with Indigenous people and that renewing that relationship and working to close “unacceptable gaps in outcomes in Indigenous communities” is something the party took “real and measurable action” on during its four years in power.With respect to the Trans Mountain pipeline, Gallant pointed to comments Trudeau made on Sept. 13, noting that “a better future” includes partnership with Indigenous people, not just consultation.“That’s why we are moving forward on proposals to allow indigenous communities and indigenous investors to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, but that’s why at the same time we’re listening very carefully to the indigenous communities who have concerns,” Trudeau said.
Canadian National	Thus far in the federal election campaign, the issue of immigration has been debated mainly by not talking about it.Two of the biggest “media” stories have been:Controversy over a billboard campaign featuring a picture of People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier, accompanied by the words: “Say NO to Mass Immigration”.Controversy over a Vancouver Sun column the paper ran criticizing ethnic diversity that it publicly denounced within hours of publishing it.In the case of the billboards, Bernier didn’t put them up but said he agreed with the sentiment. They were quickly taken down by those who erected them, saying they were responding to public complaints the message they contained was racist.
Company	Amazon is said to be developing a new payment system that allows customers to pay simply by waving their hand.The online retail giant is testing scanners that use biometric technology to identify people by the shape and size of their hands, with the hope of rolling them out in its Whole Foods stores later this year.Sensors are already being tested by Amazon workers on vending machines in the firm's New York offices, according to the New York Post.
Company	"Nearly a year after it began testing in Colombia, Facebook Dating is now available in the United States. The product, which is available to users 18 and older, will appear as a new tab within the Facebook mobile app. People who opt in to Dating can create a profile that's separate from their main Facebook profile with one tap and meet potential romantic partners among their friends of friends - or, if that makes you uncomfortable, completely outside of your existing friend network.Facebook says it will suggest matches for you based on preferences you express when you create your profile, along with your interests and Facebook activity. The app, which borrows many design elements from the dating app Hinge, allows you to send a ""like"" and a corresponding message to any profile you encounter on the service."
Company	Netflix made its name in originals with prestige shows like House of Cards, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Orange Is the New Black, each of which got five or six seasons before its run finished. But lately, that's changed, with beloved newcomers like The OA and Tuca & Bertie getting pushed out the door as soon as they fail to perform. The move wouldn't be surprising coming from a network like ABC or CBS, but Netflix has positioned itself as different than traditional TV - and that includes taking risks on weirder, more niche shows. Suddenly, it's a risk the company seems less willing to take.
Company	Spotify is adding the ability to share whatever it is you're listening to with a snap on Snapchat - long after other platforms like Instagram already got this same type of integration. So long as Snapchat is installed on the same device you're using Spotify on, you'll now see it appear in Spotify's share menu
Company, General Tech (Various buzzwords)	"Apple isn't selling as many iPhones anymore, so the company is looking for new ways to make money off its software. Now, it looks like we'll soon get an up-close look at a key part of those plans. Apple is planning to hold one of its signature flashy events at its headquarters on March 25, when it will show off at two new product offerings, according to a new report from  BuzzFeed.Unlike other spring events, which tend to feature new iPads, BuzzFeed attests the event will be ""subscription services focused"" and that new iPads and AirPods are ""unlikely."" Instead, Apple will reveal two new, long-rumored subscription services: one for news and for streaming video."
Company, Finance	The company's stock price hit a record-high Tuesday morning, opening at $133.47 per share. That's above its previous high of $133.00 on Feb. 23, 2015 and an overall rise of more than 40 percent over the last year. Apple is now valued at more than $706.6 billion, outshining Alphabet's $574.9 billion and Amazon's $401.6 billion as of Tuesday morning.
Company, General Tech (Various buzzwords)	"Google is changing its news search algorithms again, in a move that's sure to annoy everybody. Today's announcement is that the company is going to try to emphasize ""original reporting,"" which it will ""elevate"" in its search results. To do so, it has distributed new instructions to its cadre of 10,000+ human reviewers, whose feedback helps train the Google algorithm that actually delivers search rankings."
Company, Gadgets	"The Tesla pickup truck, described by Elon Musk as ""the coolest car I've ever seen,"" is now looking at a November reveal at the earliest, according to a tweet from the Tesla CEO. The science-fiction inspired electric pickup truck had been expected to arrive this summer, or October at the latest, based on previous statements made by the notoriously optimistic Musk.Beyond an early concept image of a pickup shown at the unveiling of the Tesla Semi in 2017 and an image tweeted in May, little is known about the Tesla pickup truck. Musk described it as follows in a Recode interview with Kara Swisher last year:""It's gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, ""Blade Runner"" pickup truck. It's gonna be awesome, it's gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It's like, oh, it's great."""
Company, International	Alibaba has postponed its long-awaited $15bn (?2.3bn) stock market listing in Hong Kong in the midst of pro-democracy protests in the Asian financial hub, according to reports.Reuters cited a source with knowledge of the matter as saying that Alibaba could launch its initial public offering as soon as October if tensions between protestors and Chinese police had eased and the market outlook had improved.A further source is said to have revealed that the e-commerce company's board took the decision to delay
Company	"Chinese ride hailing firm Didi Chuxing is now the second valuable venture-backed private company after it raised $4bn ( 2.9bn) in its latest funding round on Tuesday.Uber's main rival in Asia is now valued at $50bn, according to Reuters, as it looks to invest in artificial intelligence and open services beyond China.Uber current valuation stands at $68.5bn, although this may have dipped after Softbank's offer to buy shares at a discount rate in November. The ride-hailing firm said that ""there is no definitive timeline"" on expansion to the region.It said"
Company	The trucking industry drew in revenues of $796 billion in 2018, with trucks moving 71% of the nation's freight, according to the American Trucking Association, a trade group. Compare that to the global ride-hailing market, which according to Allied Market Research, was valued at just $36 billion in 2017.Uber is now a player in this market with Uber Freight. Uber Freight launched in 2017, and the program has since expanded to 48 U.S. states, as well as the Netherlands and Germany. Uber says thousands of shippers and almost half a million truck drivers currently

Finance, International	Peru's economy grew 3.28% in July from the same month a year earlier, the second highest rate this year, due principally to healthy domestic demand and a slight rally in the mining sector, the government said on Sunday.The rate was in line with analysts' estimates in a Reuters poll. The Peruvian economy grew 2.74% in the last 12 months to July, the state statistics agency Inei said.Peru is the world's No. 2 producer of copper, zinc and silver.
Finance, Company	Wendy s Co (WEN.O) said on Monday it expects a fall in its 2019 adjusted earnings, as it expands its breakfast offerings across its U.S. restaurants in 2020.The burger chain now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be down about 3.5%-6.5%, reversing its prior expectation of 3.5%-7.0% growth.The company expects to make a one-time upfront investment of about $20 million in 2019 and add about 20,000 new employees as it begins the nationwide launch of its breakfast menu, which is currently available in over 300 restaurants.The menu includes Wendy s Breakfast Baconator, Frosty ccino, and Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit in addition to other signature items such as its Applewood smoked bacon.

Finance	Sentiment in the U.S. rose more than expected this month as consumers felt more confident about current and future economic conditions, according to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan.The September print on consumer sentiment rose to 92 from 89.8 in August, the university s Surveys of Consumers data showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected sentiment to rise to 91.  The current economic conditions index also rose to 106.9 from 105.3.However, while consumers feel more confident about the economy, worries about the impact of tariffs on the economy increased in early September. Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers, said 38% of all consumers made  spontaneous references to the negative impact of tariffs, the highest percentage since March 2018.  Those who negatively mentioned tariffs also held more negative views on the overall outlook for the economy as well as anticipated higher inflation and unemployment in the year ahead,  Curtin said.China and the U.S. have been embroiled in a trade war since last year with both countries slapping tariffs on billions of dollars worth of their goods.However, sentiment around U.S.-China trade relations improved this week after President Donald Trump said he is open to reaching an interim deal with the Chinese. China will also reportedly exempt some U.S. agricultural products from tariffs.
Finance	Investors buying up stocks that tend to benefit from good U.S. relations with China will be left disappointed, according to CNBC s Jim Cramer.That s because those investors are under a false impression that  we may be having a thaw in our trade war with China,  the  Mad Money  host said Thursday.  Just one problem: it s a total misread of the situation. Cramer spoke shortly after U.S. stocks closed higher Thursday, approaching record levels, as Wall Street digested news on the U.S.-China trade war, a dispute which has lasted for more than a year and sparked stock market turmoil.President Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to delay the tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods by two weeks as a  gesture of good will  to China. The president s gesture followed an earlier move by Beijing to exempt 16 types of American products from additional tariffs, including food for livestock, cancer drugs and lubricants.
Finance	"The digital currency is headed to new record highs, says Tom Lee, co-founder, managing director and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors - but there's a catch some cryptocurrency investors may not be expecting.""Bitcoin has kind of stalled recently because the macro outlook has stalled. I think, in a world without trend, bitcoin doesn't go up,"" Lee said Thursday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""The next big catalyst, I think, is a decisive breakout in the equity markets, because I think once equities break to an all-time high, bitcoin becomes a risk-on asset.""In other words, according to Lee, as stocks go, so goes bitcoin - at least for now.""If markets make a new all-time high and we see central banks still supportive, it's kind of good for liquidity, so there's ... liquidity going into bitcoin,"" Lee said. ""More importantly, if there's an interest in acquiring some volatility, that's where you're going to see people buying bitcoin.""With Lee expecting the S&P 500 to climb to 3,125 or higher by year-end, that could mean a major rally is in the cards for the increasingly volatile digital currency. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $20,089 in late 2017, according to CoinBase."
Finance	But if you are feeling uncertain about the market - the trade standoff, Brexit, the health of the European Union, the threat of a recession and years of unprecedented stimulus by central banks - it may be time for you to diversify or consider a value-oriented strategy.Diversification is not difficult. You can easily lower risk with an equal-weighted index fund or by selecting a value-oriented index fund.There was a flurry of articles in the past week saying investors were reallocating to value strategies. Those articles were based on daily trading activity, which doesn't mean much to long-term investors. But it's a good time to assess the risk associated with index funds that are heavily weighted toward large, rapidly growing tech companies, and to look at how value stocks have performed through long periods.
Finance	"An intensifying Middle East conflict is threatening to throw the world's energy market into disarray after weekend drone attacks destroyed parts of Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq plant - one of the world's largest processors of oil - and a separate nearby oil field.On Saturday, the drone attacks, directed at Saudi Arabian oil facilities that account for nearly 10 million barrels of crude-oil production, resulted in massive plumes of black smoke emanating from the oil field, and a shutdown that could lead to about 50% of its production being at least temporarily thrown offline.Prominent crude-oil strategist Phil Flynn at Price Futures Group told MarketWatch on Sunday that the drone strike was a ""big deal"" that could result in a major spike in crude-oil prices, because of the potential disruption to global supplies."

Finance	J.C. Penney stock has been racked with volatility in recent years, but a director at the embattled department-store chain has become the latest insider to buy shares on the open market.The stock (ticker: JCP) has rebounded since hitting a record intraday low of 53 cents on Aug. 13, and has nearly doubled since to end Friday at 97 cents. It now sports a 6.7% year-to-date loss, after 2018's 67.1% plunge. That is only slightly behind the S&P 500's 20.0% rise in 2019.

Football	How will the Titans' wide receivers match up against those Colts cornerbacks? Rookies A.J. Brown and Rock Ya-Sin are two physical players, setting up for a fun battle, while Adam Humphries versus Kenny Moore II is a duel of cat-quick players. Perhaps the best one-on-one for Tennessee will be Corey Davis against Pierre Desir. The Titans will not have more than two sacks. Tennessee sacked Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield five times (and intercepted him three times) in Week 1. But the Colts have a better offensive line, as they limited Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram and the rest of the Chargers' defense to just two sacks in Week 1
Football	Dak Prescott tied a career high with four touchdown passes and threw for 405 yards as the Dallas Cowboys rolled to a season-opening 35-17 victory over the visiting New York Giants on Sunday.Prescott completed 25 of 32 passes and produced his second career 400-yard game. Prescott finished 50 yards shy of his career high set against Philadelphia last season.Prescott also set a Cowboys passing yardage record for a season opener, breaking the mark held by Troy Aikman. Aikman threw for 362 yards in the 1999 season opener against Washington.Prescott threw touchdowns to tight ends Blake Jarwin and Jason Witten and then connected with Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb.Running back Ezekiel Elliott scored the other Dallas touchdown on a 10-yard run late in the third quarter.Michael Gallup finished with seven catches for a career-best 158 yards while Cooper totaled six catches for 106 yards. It marked the first time since Nov. 8, 2015, against Philadelphia that Dallas had two receivers get at least 100 yards.
Football	Lamar Jackson tied a franchise record with five touchdown passes as his Baltimore Ravens routed the host Miami Dolphins 59-10 in Sunday s season opener for both teams.Jackson, who led all NFL quarterbacks last year with 695 rushing yards in just seven starts, spent the offseason working on his passing, and it was evident on Sunday. He completed 17 of 20 attempts for 324 yards with no interceptions.Thanks in part to Jackson, the Ravens also set a franchise record for most points in one game. Baltimore tied for the second-most points ever in an NFL season opener, trailing the 1973 Atlanta Falcons (62).There was also a record set on the Miami side, as Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick became the first player in NFL history to toss at least one touchdown pass for eight different teams.Jackson, a second-year pro, and rookie wide receiver Marquise  Hollywood  Brown   both 22 years old   had successful homecomings. Both of them are from South Florida.Brown, a first-round pick and the cousin of NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown, caught four passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns in his NFL debut.
Football	Week 1 was a tale of new faces in new places making big impacts, be it Kyler Murray rallying Arizona to a tie, Zac Taylor transforming Andy Dalton in Cincinnati, or Odell Beckham Jr. suiting up for Cleveland, complete with six-figure watch on his left wrist.Those debuts were exciting, but the most significant development of Week 1 may have involved a veteran's homecoming in his 12th year in the league.Philadelphia made it to the divisional round last season in defense of its Super Bowl LII title, but the Eagles did so while lacking anything resembling a downfield threat. Mike Wallace was supposed to play that role, but he only played in two games because of a fractured fibula suffered in Week 2.Jackson's talents were going to waste with the Buccaneers, however. Sure, the long touchdowns were there, including a 75-yarder in an upset win over Philly in Week 2. As the season wore on, though, Tampa Bay faded, and Jackson s production dipped. His targets didn t go down, but he only had one touchdown after Week 2, after scoring three in the season s first two games.The Bucs couldn t figure out their quarterback situation and struggled through a lost season. The Eagles have no such concerns. Carson Wentz is their guy, and his relationship with Jackson should be mutually beneficial. Wentz gets a true deep threat to make big plays and create space for the rest of the offense, and Jackson gets to catch passes from an MVP-caliber player.
Football	After 154 all-purpose yards in Week 1, Chargers running back Austin Ekeler will face a good defensive front in Detroit. If Ekeler can shake loose against the Lions, it could be a long day for Detroit because it would open up even more passing lanes for Philip Rivers. -- Michael RothsteinJoey Bosa records three sacks. The Chargers should heat up the pass rush against a Lions offensive line that allowed three Matthew Stafford sacks in the team's season opener against the Cardinals. Rivers posted a Total QBR of 80 on the road last season, the second-best number in the NFL. And the Lions lost four of their final five home games last season and scored 16 points or fewer in each of the four losses.
Football	 Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has more weapons around him than at any point in his career. The 2015 NFL MVP and the offense won't be limited because of Newton's offseason shoulder surgery and a preseason ankle injury. The offense will be explosive.These were things written and said coming out of training campNone have come to fruition, and because of that the Panthers' season is on the brink of disaster after a 20-14 prime-time loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for an 0-2 start.The Bucs came out with a defensive formula other teams are sure to follow. Pressure Newton with blitzes, don't worry about him as a threat to run out of the zone-read and gang up on running back Christian McCaffrey.It worked beautifully. Newton was 0-for-10 under duress with three sacks, and at one point in the fourth quarter the offense had a total of 30 yards on 19 plays inside Buccaneers territory, with 13 of those plays going for zero or negative yards.
Football	"Washington Redskins rookie receiver Terry McLaurin sped past the secondary, catching one deep ball for a score and putting himself in position for another in the season opener. Now comes the hard part: Doing it again.But McLaurin getting open -- and getting the Redskins' passing attack to click -- will be made much easier when tight end Jordan Reed returns. Reed missed the Week 1 game with a concussion suffered in the third preseason game. He remains limited in practice, but did increase his work from last week.The Redskins remain optimistic about Reed playing against Dallas on Sunday (1 p.m. ET, Fox). That would be good news for an offense already down its starting running back (Derrius Guice) and still missing holdout left tackle Trent Williams.As for the passing game? McLaurin knows Reed's return will help: ""The more weapons, the better."""
Football	Tampa Bay Buccaneers inside linebacker and No. 5 overall draft pick Devin White suffered a left knee injury against the Carolina Panthers on Thursday night and did not return to the Bucs' 20-14 win.White is expected to have an MRI on Friday, and sources confirmed to ESPN that it is believed White suffered a sprained knee. The news was first reported by Pewter Report.White suffered the injury while making a tackle on running back Christian McCaffrey in the first quarter. White was slow to get up after the play, and as he stood, the knee buckled and he went back down to the ground. White was able to walk off the field under his own power.Bucs coach Bruce Arians had said one of the big reasons the team drafted White fifth overall -- the highest a linebacker has been drafted since 2015 -- was to try to neutralize McCaffrey and New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara. Kevin Minter took over in White's absence and was given the game ball after finishing with eight tackles.
Football	Several rookie pass-catchers stood out in Week 1, producing at a level few could have seen coming so early in their careers. It was only one game, though -- can they keep the good times rolling?Our NFL Nation reporters take a look at each performance and at each player's outlook moving forward.Assets: Brown has that elite, strike-fear-in-defenses type of speed. On his 47-yard touchdown, Brown showed the ability to break away from defenders after catching a short slant. On his 83-yard score, Brown used that burst to get behind the Dolphins' defense and catch the deep ball. He became the first player in NFL history with multiple 40-plus-yard touchdown catches in a debut, and he accomplished this on his first two receptions. This type of deep weapon was lacking last year for quarterback Lamar Jackson and his big arm. Considering how defenses have to respect Baltimore's rushing attack, Brown should get opportunities for big plays downfield because safeties will bite on Jackson's play-action passes.Obstacles: Physicality and durability. Defenses are going to see whether the 5-foot-9, 170-pound Brown can hold up. To try to stop him from getting a clean release, bigger cornerbacks will look to get their hands on him at the line. The challenge for Brown is whether he can beat press coverage. With teams getting more physical with Brown, he'll have to prove he can get healthy. Brown is still dealing with pain from his surgically repaired left foot, and the Ravens have been extra cautious with him. Brown played only 14 snaps in the season opener. Baltimore is going to need to get more from him in bigger games ahead.
Football	"After his usually dazzling Los Angeles Rams offense laid an egg against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII, Sean McVay didn't want his players to focus on one bad performance in an otherwise outstanding season.He wanted them to focus on three bad performancesAs part of the Rams' offseason review, the coaching staff made the offense review and study three of their four losses from last season -- the loss to New England, and the early-December losses to the Bears and Eagles. The Rams' offense averaged 30.8 points in 2018 -- second only to the Chiefs -- but only 10.7 in those three losses. (Their other loss was a 45-35 loss to the Saints that, presumably, the defense had to rewatch a few times.)""Just wanted to find different things they did that challenged us that other teams didn't do,"" wide receiver Robert Woods told me. ""Just try and find as many little details that we could improve on to make our offense adaptable to beat anyone we play."""
Football	The Tampa Bay Buccaneers made enough defensive stops and kept the Carolina Panthers out of the end zone for the entire game in a 20-14 victory Thursday night at Bank of America Stadium at Charlotte, N.C.The final defensive stand came with a fourth-and-1 stop of Christian McCaffrey s rushing attempt at the Tampa Bay 2-yard line with less than 1:30 to play.With Carolina down to one timeout, the Buccaneers ran out the clock without giving the Panthers another possession.After taking a 12-10 lead, Carolina s next four possessions resulted in a fumble, punt, failed fourth down and a punt.The Buccaneers (1-1) followed with an 11-play possession that lasted more than 6 1/2 minutes, but they only managed Matt Gay s 32-yard field goal at the 2:30 mark for a 20-14 lead.Carolina s last possession included 11 plays and 73 yards, but no points.
Football	Matt Prater made a 33-yard field goal with 3:48 remaining in overtime to help the Detroit Lions salvage a 27-27 tie with the Arizona Cardinals, who overcame an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit Sunday in Glendale, Ariz.Prater s field goal capped a 60-yard drive after Zane Gonzalez made a 28-yard field goal, his fourth of the game, on the first possession of overtime for a 27-24 lead, capping the Cardinals  run of 21 straight points.Arizona rookie quarterback Kyler Murray, the No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft, completed 29 of 54 passes for 308 yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter when the Cardinals overcame a 24-6 deficit.Arizona had 293 of its 387 yards of total offense in the fourth quarter and overtime after a listless first three quarters.
Gadgets, Company	On the back of the iPhone 11 Pro can be found three cameras. Why? Because the more light you collect, the better your picture can be. And we pretty much reached the limit of what one camera can do a little while back. Two, three, even a dozen cameras can be put to work creating a single photo — the only limitation is the code that makes them work.Earlier in today’s announcements, Apple  showed the base-level iPhone 11 with two cameras, but it ditched the telephoto for an ultra-wide lens. But the iPhone Pro has the original wide, plus ultrawide and telephoto, its optical options covering an approximate 35mm equivalent of 13mm, 52mm and 26mm.With these three cameras you have incredible creative control, said Apple’s Phil Schiller during the stage presentation. It is so pro, you’re going to love using it.Previously the telephoto lens worked with the wide-angle camera to produce portrait mode effects or take over when the user zooms in a lot. By combining the info from both those cameras, which have a slightly different perspective, the device can determine depth data, allowing it to blur the background past a certain point, among other things.The ultra-wide lens provides even more information, which should improve the accuracy of portrait mode and other features. One nice thing about a wide angle on a dedicated sensor and camera system is the creators can build in lots of corrections so you don’t get crazy distortion at the corners or center. Fundamentally you’ll still want to back off a bit, because using an ultra-wide lens on a face gives it a weird look.

Hockey	The Calgary Flames have signed forward Andrew Mangiapane to a one-year, two-way contract worth $715,000, the club announced Sunday.The 23-year-old suited up for 44 games with the Flames last season, posting eight goals and 13 points in that span. He also spent 15 games with AHL Stockton, putting up 17 points with Calgary's minor-league affiliate.
Hockey	Hockey is back. The St. Louis Blues kicked off training camp on Friday at their beautiful new facility in Maryland Heights, Missouri. The team that took the ice was largely the same one that left the ice in the TD Garden in Boston as Stanley Cup champions just over three months ago.But even so, there are several questions to answer before the season starts: who will replace hometown hero Pat Maroon, who left for the Tampa Bay Lightning? How will the Blues look to improve a power play that was a disaster in the playoffs, and for which they brought in new assistant coach Marc Savard? And which prospects, if any, could rise to make an impact on the 2019-20 squad? Let's take a look at that question now.Mitch ReinkeThe Blues signed defenseman Mitch Reinke out of Michigan Tech just over a year ago when the youngster was a college free agent. He had just finished a 3 goal, 21 assist campaign in 35 games with the Huskies, and had earned recognition as a Western Collegiate Hockey Association Third Team All-Star. Reinke even made his NHL debut for the Blues immediately after signing, as the team's defensive core was ravaged by injuries.
Hockey	Timing is everything while discussing a topic as constantly in-flux as restricted free agent (RFA) signings this summer. This article is being written directly after Mitch Marner signed his six-year, $65.3-million contract extension with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sept. 13th. Every idea presented in this article could look completely ridiculous in a matter of weeks, days or even hours.With that caveat out of the way, here's one thing we can all agree on. For a certain caliber of NHL player, the RFA bridge deal is dead. It has slowly eroded over the years, as teams became more desperate to lock down their young core players at the peak of their careersNo longer will a two or three-year, $15-million bridge deal suffice before signing a massive extension. With stars like Auston Matthews and Marner receiving $10-plus million a year, there's no reason to believe that other RFAs of their caliber are not looking for a similar contract.Under normal circumstances, trading a player like Point would be blasphemy, as 90-point scorers under the age of 25 are a rare commodity in the NHL. However, if the Lightning simply can't reach a deal with him, then a trade may be their only course of action.The problem is, projecting the value of an RFA likely demanding a high-cost contract is difficult. The number of teams who could afford to take on a $10 million extension is limited, and the ones that could may not be willing to part with significant assets to do so.
Hockey	"Scott Stevens can be considered one of the last of a breed of NHLer that wreaked havoc on other players. During a time when checks were seemingly more vicious than in today's game, Stevens threw his share of hits that rattled opposing players; some were injured, some were just angry, but there was never a doubt that Stevens played a hard, physical game. But, was that hard, physical game considered ""dirty"" when it came to his hit on Eric Lindros?For 22 seasons Stevens played that type of game and helped the New Jersey Devils win three Stanley Cups. Some said he was dirty but others respected Stevens and knew instinctively not to cross the center line with their heads down. That was an invitation to get checked hard, as Lindros found out. It was a hit that changed his career, ended his time with the Philadelphia Flyers and ironically did some good for the sport.Currently working with the NHL Network, Stevens brought attention to the issue of concussions in the NHL. In fact, he had to retire after he was diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome."
Hockey	"Mitchell Marner and John Tavares were greeted by loud cheers from baggage handlers and other airport personnel when they arrived at St. John's International Airport on Saturday.The ovation paled in comparison to the one Marner received when he stepped on the ice for his first official workout of Maple Leafs training camp at Paradise Double Rinks Complex on Sunday.For Marner, who'd missed the first two days of drills, the show of public enthusiasm for his return to the team left the 22-year-old right wing overwhelmed after he signed a six-year, $65.358 million contract Friday.""It was pretty cool,"" Marner said. ""When we got off the plane, there were people waiting for us there. When we were driving in to the hotel, you could just feel the love for us in this city. It shows how passionate these fans are. It's not a close place to Toronto, so you see how many fans you have worldwide. It's so cool seeing that. It was great being back on the ice."""
Hockey	Max Pacioretty had a hat trick and an assist, and the Vegas Golden Knights won the NHL preseason opener, 6-2 against the Arizona Coyotes at T-Mobile Arena on Sunday.Pacioretty scored two goals in the first period, then gave Vegas a 4-2 lead at 16:53 of the second. Reilly Smith and Brayden McNabb (empty net) each scored shorthanded, and Cody Eakin had a goal and an assist. Malcolm Subban made 29 saves.Ilya Lyubushkin and Vinnie Hinostroza scored for Arizona. Adin Hill started and allowed four goals on 23 shots through two periods. Erik Kallgren made eight saves in the third.Coyotes defenseman Aaron Ness left the game at 13:49 of the first period after being hit near center ice by Golden Knights forward Keegan Kolesar, who received a five-minute major penalty for charging.
Hockey	"Sidney Crosby won't consider if the Pittsburgh Penguins' championship window is closing. He probably never will.""I don't think any of us can predict that,"" Pittsburgh's 32-year-old captain said Sunday. ""It's up to everyone else to decide what the window is and speculate on that. I think the way we train, the expectations on us, they're always going to be there.""Three of Crosby's teammates have said their chances to win another Stanley Cup championship are running out.Defenseman Kris Letang first mentioned it after an informal skate Tuesday, when he said he's another year closer to retirement. When camp opened Friday, forward Evgeni Malkin said he thinks the Penguins have between two and four more opportunities before forward Patric Hornqvist put the window at three or four seasons.But, in line with what coach Mike Sullivan said Saturday, Crosby said he is solely looking toward this season. Next season will have his full attention when it arrives. That pattern will continue as long as Crosby plays."
Hockey	"Zach Hyman likely will be out at least for the first month of the season, if not more, Toronto Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock said.""Hyman, I think he's going to miss 14 or 15 games, so there's a real good opportunity for someone else. So why not [Kasperi Kapanen ]?"" Babcock said.Kapanen will get the first shot to replace Hyman at left wing on a line with center John Tavares and right wing Mitchell Marner.Hyman had surgery in April to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He was injured in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference First Round against the Boston Bruins."
Hockey	Kyle Dubas was smiling like he had won the Stanley Cup.But it should have been Mitch Marner with the Cheshire Cat-like grin.He was the winner on this Saturday afternoon. The winner by knockout or unanimous decision. You take your pick.The deal is done and Marner will be paid $65+ million over the next six years — which makes sense if he was a better player than Nikita Kucherov in Tampa or Brad Marchand in Boston.Which he may be one day but just hasn’t been yet.Kucherov is the NHL’s most valuable player and leading scorer. He’ll earn $1 million a year less than Marner with the Lightning. Marchand, older and more accomplished than Marner, will be paid $6.1 million by the Boston Bruins, a whole $4 million less than Marner comes in at.And the two teams that finished ahead of the Leafs in the Atlantic Division have their best forwards all signed up under far more economic circumstances than Toronto finds itself in.
Hockey	Being on any power play is fun, but joining one that boasts Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is pretty much any goal scorer’s dream.“They’re a different level of skill,” said Oilers winger James Neal, who skated on the first unit in practice Sunday. “They have that ability to draw guys in and dish pucks out when you’re all alone.“You know when you’re on the power play that (the PK) focus is trying to get the puck out of their hands, so there are going to be a lot of opportunities for open ice.“For me, that’s a great thing. Being able to get open and put the puck in the net is one of my best attributes.”
Hockey	It’s the most important position in sports – which, surely, makes this the most important ranking in sports. OK, maybe not, but here’s how the NHL’s 31 projected starting netminders stack up as teams head into training camp for the 2019-20 season:1. Andrei Vasilevskiy, Tampa Bay Lightning: The reigning Vezina Trophy winner is exceptionally acrobatic for his size, he’s just entering his prime and he’s set up for success in Tampa Bay. Does it help that he plays for the NHL’s best (regular season) team? Of course it does. But he’s also a big part of the Bolts’ winning ways.2. Sergei Bobrovsky, Florida Panthers: He was a savior in Columbus. He faces a similar challenge in Florida, where the Panthers are counting on the two-time Vezina recipient to lift the franchise into the realm of respectability – and the playoffs.3. Ben Bishop, Dallas Stars: Big goalie had the best stat line last season (1.98 goals-against average, .934 save percentage), but he was limited to 46 games due to injuries. Dallas is intent on competing for a Stanley Cup, and Bishop is a key component.4. Carey Price, Montreal Canadiens: It wasn’t too long ago that Price had a firm grasp on the “best goalie in the world” mantle. A couple of down years – mostly due to injuries and an inconsistent team in front of him – have knocked him off that perch, but he came on strong in the second half last season and could be on his way back up to the top of the rankings.5. Tuukka Rask, Boston Bruins: It’s like the old argument about Martin Brodeur and the Devils. Is Rask so good because of the team in front of him, or are the Bruins so good because they have Rask in net? A little from column A, a little from column B.
Hockey	Dallas Stars general manager Jim Nill is likely to get at least a few offers for disgruntled defenseman Julius Honka. After all, many teams are in need of a right-handed, puck-moving defenseman. A lack of demand is not the problem. What is, however, is how the Stars are one of them.Obviously, Honka does not have an extensive NHL resume at this stage, even as a soon-to-be 24-year-old. That presents multiple problems for Nill, seeing as Honka was healthy-scratched for the Stars’ final 35 regular-season games and didn’t see any playoff action. As a result, the Stars don’t exactly know what they have in the 2014 first-round pick, who only has a total of 87 NHL games under his belt. Nor is his value exactly at an all-time high.So, the solution should be clear: Play him.
International, Finance	Carlos Martínez Mongay, Deputy Director General in the European Commission's Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, opened the event with an assessment of the economic outlookGathering in Paris for the 2019 Global Government Finance Summit, finance department leaders from 10 countries debated the political risks threatening economic growth – and their roots in rising inequality, local decline, trade tensions and rapid migration. Matt Ross reports“Governments and finance ministries have always had to face new challenges, but in the modern world these are faster moving and more globalised than ever before,” said Kevin Sorkin. “And many of the solutions demand partnerships with other nations and stronger relationships between the public, private and social sectors. So the Global Government Finance Summit exists to help you as leaders of finance ministries to learn from and build links with your peers overseas, identifying the tools and innovations that can help you overcome the challenges you face.”Sorkin, the Director of Global Government Forum, was welcoming delegates from 10 countries on four continents to the 2019 Summit, held in Paris during the summer. The European Commission was also represented at the event, which was hosted by France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance and supported by knowledge partners EY and Swiss Re. And after the evening dinner Carlos Martínez Mongay, Deputy Director General in the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, gave the Commission’s assessment of the economic outlook.As manufactured goods trade shrank around the world, he said, the EU had an “unpleasant surprise” during 2018 – with growth slowing rapidly: the Commission’s summer forecasts put GDP growth across the union at 1.2% this year, and 1.5% next. Some aspects of the Eurozone’s economy are in reasonably good shape, he explained: tight labour markets are likely to drive up wages – boosting real disposable income and thus consumption – while inflation “shall continue to remain subdued, rising only gradually.” And member states’ budget deficits have fallen to a 20-year low, averaging less than 1%.
International, Finance	Despite low interest rates, uncertainty generated by the U.S.-China trade war is holding back new business investment, while U.S. manufacturing shrank in August for the first time in three years. With this fall’s tariffs hitting products that households regularly purchase, there are also some signs that consumers—the principal remaining source of growth in the American economy—may be losing confidence as well. The latest round in the trade war will be more tangible and potentially more serious in its immediate effects because of the co-dependent relationship between American consumers and Chinese exporters. China accounts for about a third of U.S. clothing imports and around half of total imports of footwear, household textiles—such as bed linens, towels and curtains—and furniture. Toys and games were among the products delayed to December because China accounts for an astounding 80 percent of such imports. Given the degree of dependence on Chinese suppliers in so many sectors, Trump’s “order” last month to American companies to leave China—had it been serious or within his authority as president, which it arguably wasn’t—would have been hugely disruptive and costly for firms in both countries. It is true that even before Trump took office, many of the retailers and other buyers at the top of China-centric supply chains were looking for alternatives because wages and other costs in China are rising. But for the most part, they are not returning to the United States. Rather, other Southeast Asian countries, for example Vietnam, are becoming major suppliers of clothing and other consumer products. The trade war is no doubt accelerating these efforts, but it takes time and resources to find and develop relationships with other suppliers.
International, Finance	Trump thinks signs of economic weakness in China, and the reshuffling of global supply chains, give him leverage in the trade negotiations with Beijing. But weaker economic growth in China and in the rest of the world is also bad for American exporters, which is another blow to aggregate demand at home. And if American consumers start to pull back, the U.S. economy could be in big trouble. Beijing believes it has the tools to cope with an economic slowdown, which some experts doubt has much to do with the trade war anyway. Moreover, the Chinese leadership simply doesn’t trust Trump to stick to any deal he makes, so they prefer to wait him out. After all, they are not the ones who have to face voters next year.
International, US National	President Donald Trump’s acting national security adviser, former Reagan administration official Charles Kupperman, made an extraordinary and controversial claim in the early 1980s: nuclear conflict with the USSR was winnable and that “nuclear war is a destructive thing but still in large part a physics problem.”Kupperman’s suggestion that the U.S. could triumph in a nuclear war went against dominant theories of mutually assured destruction and ignored the long-term destabilizing effects that such hostilities would have on the planet’s health and global politics.Kupperman, appointed to his new post on Tuesday after Trump fired his John Bolton from the job, argued it was possible to win a nuclear war “in the classical sense,” and that the notion of total destruction stemming from such a superpower conflict was inaccurate. He said that in a scenario in which 20 million people died in the U.S. as opposed to 150 million, the nation could then emerge as the stronger side and prevail in its objectives.His argument was that with enough planning and civil defense measures, such as “a certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials,” the effects of a nuclear war could be limited and that U.S. would be able to fairly quickly rebuild itself after an all-out conflict with the then-Soviet Union.“It may take 15 years, but geez, look how long it took Europe to recover after the Second World War,” Kupperman said. Referring to the Japanese city on which the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in 1945, he also claimed that “Hiroshima, after it was bombed, was back and operating three days later.”
International	When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met dozens of African leaders and business executives at the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in Yokohama late last month, two things were clear.First, Tokyo would take on China head to head in resource-rich Africa, where Beijing already has the upper hand in development lending and trade.China is Africa’s biggest trading partner, with two-way trade growing twentyfold in the past two decades to US$204 billion last year, according to China’s Commerce Ministry.China’s rapidly growing trade with African countries has jolted Japan, whose total with the continent is less than 10 per cent of China’s, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation.Second, Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy behind the United States and China, plans to take its battle with Beijing for East Asian supremacy to the doorstep of the United Nations Security Council.In Yokohama, Japanese officials sought African countries’ support for its push for reforms at the council, including getting Japan, Germany, Brazil, India and other nations added as permanent members.Winning permanent membership on the body would allow those countries to wield veto power just like the present five permanent members – China, Britain, France, the United States and Russia.Besides the five permanent members, the council has 10 non-permanent members that serve two-year terms.
International	On society surviving nuclear war:Scheer: Is it possible to survive it with your civilization intact?Kupperman: Well, it is possible to survive it with a certain amount of society intact, it depends on what steps we take to ensure that survivability. It certainly won’t be the same as before the war. But generally societies have been intact ― like Germany and Japan and Western Europe in the Second World War weren’t the same after the war as they were before. But generally societies have been intact. The question really gets down to political credibility in the conduct of your foriegn policy. If you look like you are serious about defending yourself and your allies with real civil defense programs and other measures, I think that has political credibility with the adversary. An adversaryisn’t going to take somebody seriously if they don’t take steps to protect themselves. Nuclear war is a destructive thing, but it is still in large part a physics problem.Scheer: What do you mean?Kupperman: Well, sheltering yourself against nuclear effects can be done, it just depends on how much effort and money one wants to spend on it, but a certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials can assure the survivability of somebody, assuming they aren’t at ground zero of a detonation. Hiroshima, after it was bombed, was back and operating three days later. So it is certainly a destructive weapon, and nobody wants a nuclear war, but I don’t think the United States in the past has been serious enough about planning for its survival in the event of a nuclear war...On winning nuclear war “in a classical sense”: Kupperman: It depends on what one considers all-out. If the objective in a war is to try to destroy as many Soviet civilians and as many American civilians as is feasible, and the casualty levels approached 150 million on each side, then it’s going to be tough to say you have a surviving nation after that. But depending on how the nuclear war is fought, it could mean the difference between 150 casualties and 20 million casualties. I think that is a significant difference, and if the country loses 20 million people, you may have a chance of surviving after that.Scheer: Would that mean the other nation would survive as well? You’re not talking about winning a nuclear war, you’re talking about a stalemate of some kind.Kupperman: It may or may not be a stalemate, depending on who had more surviving national power and military power.Scheer: So you think it is possible to win?Kupperman: I think it is possible to win, in the classical sense.Scheer: What does that mean, “in the classical sense”?Kupperman: It means that it is clear after the war that one side is stronger than the other side, the weaker side is going to accede to the demands of the stronger side.
International, Finance	France’s income inequalities remain at the lower end of the scale, says Michel Houdebine, Chief Economist at France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the country has been pushing for global action on the issue. But many countries have been slow in reacting to rising inequality: “The international community missed things that led to increased inequality, and that’s one of the factors behind this political instability,” he said.The political and economic risks emerging around the world, warned Martínez Mongay, could interact in ways which exacerbate their impact. For example, he said, a US-China trade war could further drag down the world economy, triggering “a global shift in business sentiment, and therefore – taking into account the high leverage of both financial and non-financial companies – lead to a rapid tightening of global financial conditions, with knock-on effects for the emerging markets with financial vulnerabilities.”Brexit presents another major set of political and economic risks. In the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum, Martínez Mongay recalled, most analysts foresaw a 15% depreciation in Sterling and sharp falls in investor confidence and business investment. These predictions proved accurate, although strong global and EU growth during 2017 have helped to keep the UK’s economy moving forward.Analysts – including the European Commission – also wrongly anticipated that UK consumer confidence would take a knock, Martínez Mongay said; but while consumption held up for some years, “that shock has been materialising recently, if slowly.” Recent data “would suggest that Brexit uncertainty is denting both investor and consumer confidence,” he added.
International, Finance	Asked how the EU and member states should respond to these threats, Houdebine called for a focus on “education, training, and mobility so people can move to find a job”, and argued for international action on inequality: “Inequalities in one country are a concern for others,” he said.Martínez Mongay agreed: “There is more and more empirical evidence that high levels of inequality – in wealth as well as income – constrain growth; and further concentration in markets and higher mark-ups is the other side of this coin of this increase in inequality.” He called for an “inclusive multilateralism” in the pursuit of concerted action: as well as addressing inequality and strengthening market competition, he argued, this agenda “should also tackle the need for a fair system of taxation of multinationals, which implies appropriate allocation of taxing rights, putting a floor to tax competition, and limiting profit-shifting.”As the session moved onto wider debate around the issues, one delegate pointed out that inequality had grown markedly in the US and UK during the 1980s – without creating such political instability. “The thing that I think has made it particularly toxic is the fact that average real wage growth has been so weak, associated with very low productivity growth,” they commented. “So that’s another key part of the recipe we need to look at.”
International	"For two hours they talked, an unlikely pair in a hotel bar in Japan.One night after G20 meetings in Osaka, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sat down over beers with a world leader whom aides say he greatly admires: German Chancellor Angela Merkel.At a time when government leaders in the United States, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and beyond, are upending or defying rules-based international relations, Merkel remains a champion of multilateralism and the global institutions that support peace, security and liberal democracy — all touchstones of Trudeau's foreign policy.So perhaps Trudeau was channelling Merkel in his big foreign policy speech Aug. 24 in Montreal when he curiously quoted other world leaders and experts who counselled him that ""the world has changed, and quickly.""""2019 looks very different than 2015,"" he said.That's an understatement.Canada's own Global Affairs bureaucracy did not foresee the election of the ""America First"" President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping's tightening grip on power, Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections, the Brexit vote, the poisoning of former agents on British soil or the brazen and brutal murder of a Saudi journalist in an embassy in Istanbul.Yet, foreign policy isn't usually seen as a vote-driver in Canada.An Angus Reid Institute survey of 2,000 people last week said only 31 per cent of uncommitted voters cited Canada's role on the world stage as among their top priority issues. When asked to pick just one priority, the number dropped to 1 per cent who said it mattered most.""At this stage in the campaign, foreign policy and Canada's place on the world stage is not the issue that it was four years ago,"" says Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute."
International	"Kurl and others say global politics is unquestionably a factor when voters look at party leaders to take their measure in order to decide who can be trusted to reflect, give voice to, and stand up for Canadian interests. Politicians know it too and use foreign policy as a way of communicating leadership to a domestic audience.So just what are the Liberals telegraphing in 2019? And what's the counternarrative by his opponents?For Trudeau, it's a way to show he embraces collaborative leadership not the politics of division. Andrew Scheer uses it as a wedge to portray Trudeau as weak or naive, whether it's caving to Trump or failing to stand up to China.Surprisingly, while Trudeau says the world has changed, his prescription for confronting many of its challenges have not.There are hints he will have more to say during the campaign, but Trudeau's Montreal speech underscored that his priorities remain fighting global warming, promoting liberalized international trade agreements that include ""progressive"" protections for labour, environment, gender and Indigenous rights, and making middle class growth an ""international priority."""
International	"Trudeau insists addressing the economic anxieties of the middle class around the world is the antidote to destructive waves of populism sweeping many countries, and that playing by international rules is the only way to do that. It is a more sweeping vision than Trudeau outlined in a June 2015 foreign policy speech ahead of the last election, when he was trailing third in the polls.Actually, it has distinct echoes of a 2017 speech by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to the Commons which outlined the Liberal vision of Canada's place in a world and offered a substantive but subtle rebuttal to Trumpism and the U.S. president's go-it-alone approach.Trudeau is blunter. He directly targeted conservative politicians in Canada and around the world who he said deny ""the existential threat"" of climate change and oppose his efforts to secure ""progressive"" gains in new trade deals like NAFTA.Trudeau's government ultimately signed trade deals with Europe and the Trans-Pacific Partnership that were initiated under Stephen Harper, and did end up incorporating some progressive elements, but the NAFTA deal is widely seen as the major foreign policy success of his term in power.David MacNaughton, Trudeau's former ambassador to Washington and a key player that helped nailed the deal, says ""My own personal view is we ended up significantly better than I thought we would at the beginning.""And despite the criticism by Conservatives like Scheer and Stephen Harper, MacNaughton and Trudeau insist it will be those progressive elements that will ultimately help get the deal through a Democrat majority Congress."
International	"Scheer is where Trudeau was, trying to contrast the Liberal leader with what a Conservative-led government would deliver: namely a more muscular presence on the world stage.He pledges a get-tough approach to China, saying he'd sue China at the WTO for blocking Canadian canola, end Ottawa's $200 million investment in a Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (that all our allies except the U.S. have supported), and ban Chinese telecom giant Huawei from participating in Canada's 5G wireless network. He wants to join the U.S. in a continental missile defence system.But while Conservatives slammed Trudeau for his ""virtue signalling"" pursuit of gender and Indigenous rights guarantees, Scheer says the party will nevertheless support the newly renegotiated NAFTA when it comes for a ratification vote in Parliament.Roland Paris, a University of Ottawa professor and a former Trudeau adviser on foreign policy, says when it comes to differences between Conservatives and Liberals on a wide range of trade, defence and security matters, there is less than meets the eye.Both say they will aim to shore up Canada's international alliances, diversify trade, and identify their solutions as pragmatic, but no party is articulating an isolationist position, for example a Brexit approach, he notes.And all illustrate a ""deep-seated openness to the world"" and a desire to engage the world that has become central to Canada's identity.So far, Paris says, Scheer seems more open than Harper to international alliances. Scheer said he'd look to boost ties with Canada's ""Five Eyes"" partners – the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand – and with other ""confident"" and ""like-minded nations"" in Asia and Africa and South America.Along with China, Paris says, the Scheer-led Conservatives will undoubtedly highlight different stances on Israel, Iran, climate change and religious freedom."
International, US National	Political Scientist Michael Gunter says powerful hurricanes like Dorian reinforce the need to confront the reality of climate change before it’s too late. Gunter says the solution is two fold: changing the way we live to slow climate change and adapting to a warmer planet. Gunter is an author and speaker on global environmental affairs and a professor and international relations director at Rollins College. Two years ago he published an op ed in USA Today:  Confront climate change or count on ever crueler hurricanes and Septembers. “No one weather event, as the climate scientists say, can be attributed to climate change, but stronger and stronger weather events like Hurricane Dorian are much more likely,” says Gunter.Gunter says Florida is “ground zero” for climate change.“We have sea level rise, we have stronger hurricanes to deal with. I think that even as the science has gotten stronger, the political, ideological divide has widened.”Gunter says bridging that divide is a challenge.“It’s tough. We’ve really siloed our political discourse with social media and online access.”
International, Finance	It didn’t take long for the U.S.-China trade war to get worse. Even though negotiators have agreed to meet in Washington next month, they are unlikely to see a breakthrough. If things continue on their current course, they will keep getting worse from now until the end of the year, when there will be tariffs of 15 to 30 percent on almost everything the United States imports from China. In part because of the trade war, Chinese economic growth is now expected to fall below 6 percent later this year. Slowing global trade is also hitting the export-driven German economy, which may be slipping into a recession—perhaps to be followed by other parts of Europe and the United Kingdom with the chaos of Brexit. Despite what President Donald Trump seems to believe, the U.S. economy is not immune to what happens in the rest of the world. And his protectionist trade policies are making things worse, both abroad and in the United States. The latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs came after Trump announced at the end of July that he would impose additional 10 percent tariffs on Sept. 1 on most of the $300 billion in Chinese exports that had previously been spared. The administration subsequently announced that tariffs on around $160 billion in imports of toys, smartphones and other electronics would be delayed to Dec. 15, the first time that Trump has conceded that the tariffs are hurting American consumers, not just Chinese producers.
Science	"The new comet, C/2019 Q4, is still inbound toward the Sun, but it will remain farther than the orbit of Mars and will approach no closer to Earth than about 190 million miles, or 300 million kilometers.After the initial detections of the comet, Scout system, which is located at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, automatically flagged the object as possibly being interstellar. Davide Farnocchia of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at JPL worked with astronomers and the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Center in Frascati, Italy, to obtain additional observations. He then worked with the NASA-sponsored Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to estimate the comet's precise trajectory and determine whether it originated within our solar system or came from elsewhere in the galaxy.The comet is currently 260 million miles, or 420 million kilometers, from the Sun and will reach its closest point, or perihelion, on December 8, 2019, at a distance of about 190 million miles, or 300 million kilometers.""The comet's current velocity is high, about 93000 mph, or 150000 kph, which is well above the typical velocities of objects orbiting the Sun at that distance,"" said Farnocchia. ""The high velocity indicates not only that the object likely originated from outside our solar system, but also that it will leave and head back to interstellar space."""
Science	A newly identified species of pterosaur is among the largest ever flying animals, according to a new study from Queen Mary University of London.Cryodrakon boreas, from the Azhdarchid group of pterosaurs, often incorrectly called pterodactyls, was a flying reptile with a wingspan of up to 10 metres which lived during the Cretaceous period around 77 million years ago.Its remains were discovered 30 years ago in Alberta, Canada, but palaeontologists had assumed they belonged to an already known species of pterosaur discovered in Texas, USA, named Quetzalcoatlus.The study, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, reveals it is actually a new species and the first pterosaur to be discovered in Canada.Dr David Hone, lead author of the study from Queen Mary University of London, said: This is a cool discovery, we knew this animal was here but now we can show it is different to other azhdarchids and so it gets a name.
Science	The largest-ever study of ancient human DNA, along with the first genome of an individual from the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, reveal in unprecedented detail the shifting ancestry of Central and South Asian populations over time.The research, published online Sept. 5 in a pair of papers in Science and Cell, also answers longstanding questions about the origins of farming and the source of Indo-European languages in South and Central Asia.Geneticists, archaeologists and anthropologists from North America, Europe, Central Asia and South Asia analyzed the genomes of 524 never before-studied ancient individuals. The work increased the worldwide total of published ancient genomes by about 25 percent.By comparing these genomes to one another and to previously sequenced genomes, and by putting the information into context alongside archaeological, linguistic and other records, the researchers filled in many of the key details about who lived in various parts of this region from the Mesolithic Era, which is about 12000 years ago, to the Iron Age, which is until around 2000 years ago, and how they relate to the people who live there today.With this many samples, we can detect subtle interactions between populations as well as outliers within populations, something that has only become possible in the last couple of years through technological advances, said David Reich, co-senior author of both papers and professor of genetics in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.
Science	A new study coordinated by researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, examined the association between total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drink consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality.The study included data from more than 450000 people in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, EPIC, cohort, with an average follow-up period of more than 16 years. Compared with participants who drank less than one glass of sugar-sweetened or artificially sweetened soft drinks per month, participants who drank two or more glasses of these drinks per day had a higher risk of all-cause mortality.In addition, consumption of two or more glasses of artificially sweetened soft drinks per day was found to be positively associated with deaths from circulatory diseases, and consumption of one or more glasses of sugar-sweetened soft drinks per day was found to be positively associated with deaths from digestive diseases.The International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, is part of the World Health Organization. Its mission is to coordinate and conduct research on the causes of human cancer and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and to develop scientific strategies for cancer control. The Agency is involved in both epidemiological and laboratory research and disseminates scientific information through publications, meetings, courses, and fellowships.
Science	The often embraced cheat day is a common theme in many diets and the popular ketogenic diet is no exception. But new research from UBC's Okanagan campus says that just one 75-gram dose of glucose, which is the equivalent a large bottle of soda or a plate of fries, while on a high fat, low carbohydrate diet can lead to damaged blood vessels.The ketogenic, or keto, diet has become very common for weight loss or to manage diseases like type 2 diabetes, says Jonathan Little, associate professor in the School of Health and Exercise Sciences at UBCO and study senior author. It consists of eating foods rich in fats, moderate in protein, but very low in carbohydrates and it causes the body to go into a state called ketosis.Little says the diet can be very effective because once the body is in ketosis and starved for its preferred fuel glucose, the body's chemistry changes and it begins to aggressively burn its fat stores. This leads to weight loss and can reverse the symptoms of diseases like Type 2 diabetes.We were interested in finding out what happens to the body's physiology once a dose of glucose is reintroduced, says Cody Durrer, UBC Okanagan doctoral student and study first author. Since impaired glucose tolerance and spikes in blood sugar levels are known to be associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular disease, it made sense to look at what was happening in the blood vessels after a sugar hit.For their test, the researchers recruited nine healthy young males and had them consume a 75-gram glucose drink before and after a seven-day high fat, low carbohydrate diet. The diet consisted of 70 per cent fat, 10 per cent carbohydrates and 20 per cent protein, similar to that of a modern ketogenic diet.We were originally looking for things like an inflammatory response or reduced tolerance to blood glucose, says Durrer. What we found instead were biomarkers in the blood suggesting that vessel walls were being damaged by the sudden spike in glucose.Little says the most likely culprit for the damage is the body's own metabolic response to excess blood sugar, which causes blood vessel cells to shed and possibly die.Even though these were otherwise healthy young males, when we looked at their blood vessel health after consuming the glucose drink, the results looked like they might have come from someone with poor cardiovascular health, adds Little. It was somewhat alarming.
Science	A new study has for the first time identified regions of the genome associated with left-handedness in the general population and linked their effects with brain architecture. The study, led by researchers at the University of Oxford who were funded by the Medical Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation, and Wellcome, linked these genetic differences with the connections between areas of the brain related to language.It was already known that genes have a partial role in determining handedness, studies of twins have estimated that 25 percent of the variation in handedness can be attributed to genes, but which genes these are had not been established in the general population.The new study, published in the journal Brain, identified some of the genetic variants associated with left-handedness by analysing the genomes of about 400000 people from UK Biobank, which included 38332 left-handers.Of the four genetic regions they identified, three of these were associated with proteins involved in brain development and structure. In particular, these proteins were related to microtubules, which are part of the scaffolding inside cells, called the cytoskeleton, which guides the construction and functioning of the cells in the body.Using detailed brain imaging from approximately 10000 of these participants, the researchers found that these genetic effects were associated with differences in brain structure in white matter tracts, which contain the cytoskeleton of the brain that joins language-related regions
Science	A Newcastle University study involving thousands of families is helping prospective parents work out whether they are likely to have sons or daughters.The work by Corry Gellatly, a research scientist at the university, has shown that men inherit a tendency to have more sons or more daughters from their parents. This means that a man with many brothers is more likely to have sons, while a man with many sisters is more likely to have daughters.The research involved a study of 927 family trees containing information on 556387 people from North America and Europe going back to 1600.The family tree study showed that whether you’re likely to have a boy or a girl is inherited. We now know that men are more likely to have sons if they have more brothers but are more likely to have daughters if they have more sisters. However, in women, you just can’t predict it, Mr Gellatly explains.Men determine the sex of a baby depending on whether their sperm is carrying an X or Y chromosome. An X chromosome combines with the mother’s X chromosome to make a baby girl, XX, and a Y chromosome will combine with the mother’s to make a boy, XY.The Newcastle University study suggests that an as-yet undiscovered gene controls whether a man’s sperm contains more X or more Y chromosomes, which affects the sex of his children. On a larger scale, the number of men with more X sperm compared to the number of men with more Y sperm affects the sex ratio of children born each year.
Science	"Now, physicists from MIT and elsewhere have ""heard"" the ringing of an infant black hole for the first time, and found that the pattern of this ringing does, in fact, predict the black hole's mass and spin, which is more evidence that Einstein was right all along.The findings, published today in Physical Review Letters, also favor the idea that black holes lack any sort of ""hair"", which is a metaphor referring to the idea that black holes, according to Einstein's theory, should exhibit just three observable properties: mass, spin, and electric charge. All other characteristics, which the physicist John Wheeler termed ""hair,"" should be swallowed up by the black hole itself, and would therefore be unobservable.The team's findings today support the idea that black holes are, in fact, hairless. The researchers were able to identify the pattern of a black hole's ringing, and, using Einstein's equations, calculated the mass and spin that the black hole should have, given its ringing pattern. These calculations matched measurements of the black hole's mass and spin made previously by others.If the team's calculations deviated significantly from the measurements, it would have suggested that the black hole's ringing encodes properties other than mass, spin, and electric charge, which would have been tantalizing evidence of physics beyond what Einstein's theory can explain. But as it turns out, the black hole's ringing pattern is a direct signature of its mass and spin, giving support to the notion that black holes are bald-faced giants, lacking any extraneous, hair-like properties."
Science	Results from the Kepler satellite mission, which discovered nearly two thirds of all known exoplanets to date, indicate that five to twenty percent of Earths and super-Earths are located in the habitable zone of their stars. However, despite this abundance, probing the conditions and atmospheric properties on any of these habitable zone planets is extremely difficult and has remained elusive. Until now.A new study by Professor Bjorn Benneke of the Institute for Research on Exoplanets at the University of Montreal, his doctoral student Caroline Piaulet and several of their collaborators reports the detection of water vapour and perhaps even liquid water clouds in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. This exoplanet is about nine times more massive than our Earth and is found in the habitable zone of the star it orbits. This M-type star is smaller and cooler than our Sun, but due to K2-18b's close proximity to its star, the planet receives almost the same total amount of energy from its star as our Earth receives from the Sun.The similarities between the exoplanet K2-18b and the Earth suggest to astronomers that the exoplanet may potentially have a water cycle possibly allowing water to condense into clouds and liquid water rain to fall. This detection was made possible by combining eight transit observations, the moment when an exoplanet passes in front of its star, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Science	"A University of Queensland-led international team of researchers say they have discovered a new kind of quantum time order.UQ physicist Dr Magdalena Zych said the discovery arose from an experiment the team designed to bring together elements of the two big, but contradictory, physics theories developed in the past century.Our proposal sought to discover: what happens when an object massive enough to influence the flow of time is placed in a quantum state? Dr Zych said.She said Einstein's theory described how the presence of a massive object slowed time.Imagine two spaceships, asked to fire at each other at a specified time while dodging the other's attack, she said.If either fires too early, it will destroy the other.In Einstein's theory, a powerful enemy could use the principles of general relativity by placing a massive object, like a planet, closer to one ship to slow the passing of time.Because of the time lag, the ship furthest away from the massive object will fire earlier, destroying the other.Dr Zych said the second theory, of quantum mechanics, says any object can be in a state of superpositionThis means it can be found in different states, think Schrodinger's cat, she said.Dr Zych said using the theory of quantum mechanics, if the enemy put the planet into a state of quantum superposition, then time also should be disrupted.There would be a new way for the order of events to unfold, with neither of the events being first or second, but in a genuine quantum state of being both first and second,"" she said."
Science	Superhard materials can slice, drill and polish other objects. They also hold potential for creating scratch-resistant coatings that could help keep expensive equipment safe from damage.Now, science is opening the door to the development of new materials with these seductive qualities.Researchers have used computational techniques to identify 43 previously unknown forms of carbon that are thought to be stable and superhard, including several predicted to be slightly harder than or nearly as hard as diamonds. Each new carbon variety consists of carbon atoms arranged in a distinct pattern in a crystal lattice.The study, published on September third in the journal npj Computational Materials, combines computational predictions of crystal structures with machine learning to hunt for novel materials. The work is theoretical research, meaning that scientists have predicted the new carbon structures but have not created them yet.Diamonds are right now the hardest material that is commercially available, but they are very expensive, says University at Buffalo chemist Eva Zurek. I have colleagues who do high-pressure experiments in the lab, squeezing materials between diamonds, and they complain about how expensive it is when the diamonds break.
Science	Two University of Hawaii at Manoa researchers have identified and corrected a subtle error that was made when applying Einstein's equations to model the growth of the universe.Physicists usually assume that a cosmologically large system, such as the universe, is insensitive to details of the small systems contained within it. Kevin Croker, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Joel Weiner, a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics, have shown that this assumption can fail for the compact objects that remain after the collapse and explosion of very large stars.For 80 years, we've generally operated under the assumption that the universe, in broad strokes, was not affected by the particular details of any small region, said Croker. It is now clear that general relativity can observably connect collapsed stars, which are regions the size of Honolulu, to the behavior of the universe as a whole, over a thousand billion billion times larger.Croker and Weiner demonstrated that the growth rate of the universe can become sensitive to the averaged contribution of such compact objects. Likewise, the objects themselves can become linked to the growth of the universe, gaining or losing energy depending on the objects' compositions. This result is significant since it reveals unexpected connections between cosmological and compact object physics, which in turn leads to many new observational predictions.One consequence of this study is that the growth rate of the universe provides information about what happens to stars at the end of their lives. Astronomers typically assume that large stars form black holes when they die, but this is not the only possible outcome. In 1966, Erast Gliner, a young physicist at the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in Leningrad, proposed an alternative hypothesis that very large stars should collapse into what could now be called Generic Objects of Dark Energy, or GEODEs. These appear to be black holes when viewed from the outside but, unlike black holes, they contain Dark Energy instead of a singularity.In 1998, two independent teams of astronomers discovered that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, consistent with the presence of a uniform contribution of Dark Energy. It was not recognized, however, that GEODEs could contribute in this way. With the corrected formalism, Croker and Weiner showed that if a fraction of the oldest stars collapsed into GEODEs, instead of black holes, their averaged contribution today would naturally produce the required uniform Dark Energy.
Science	Fleets of microscopic machines toil away in your cells, carrying out critical biological tasks and keeping you alive. By combining theory and experiment, researchers have discovered the surprising way one of these machines, called the spindle, avoids slowdowns: congestion.The spindle divides chromosomes in half during cell division, ensuring that both offspring cells contain a full set of genetic material. The spindle is made up of tens of thousands of stiff, hollow tubes called microtubules connected by biological motors.Microtubules are only propelled forward when connected to a neighbor pointed in the opposite direction. Previous observations, however, showed microtubules cruising at full speed even when linked only to neighbors facing the same way. In a new paper published September 2 in Nature Physics, the researchers provide an answer to this puzzle. The microtubules are so entangled with one another that even those not actively launched forward get dragged along at full speed by the crowd.It's like a New York City crosswalk, says study lead author Sebastian Fürthauer, a research scientist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Biology, or CCB, in New York City. People walking different ways are all mixed together, yet everyone is able to move at full speed and flow smoothly past one another.The findings will help scientists better understand the cellular machinery that segregates chromosomes during cell division and why this process sometimes goes wrong. If a spindle does its job incorrectly, it can introduce errors such as missing or extra chromosomes that can lead to complications like infertility and cancer, Fürthauer says.
Science	South American rivers are home to at least three different species of electric eels, including a newly identified species capable of generating a greater electrical discharge than any other known animal, according to a new analysis of 107 fish collected in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname in recent years.Scientists have known for more than 250 years that electric eels, which send electricity pulsing through the water to stun their prey, live in the Amazon basin. They are widely distributed in swamps, streams, creeks, and rivers across northern South America, and have long been thought to belong to a single species. With modern genetic and ecological analyses, however, researchers at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History have discovered that electric eels in the Amazon basin belong to three different species that evolved from a shared ancestor millions of years ago. The findings are reported Sept. 10 in the journal Nature Communications.The identification of two new species of electric eel highlights how much remains to be discovered within the Amazon rainforest, one of Earth's biodiversity hotspots, as well as the importance of protecting and preserving this threatened environment, says study leader C. David de Santana, a research associate in the museum's division of fishes. These fish grow to be seven to eight feet long. They're really conspicuous, he says. If you can discover a new eight-foot-long fish after 250 years of scientific exploration, can you imagine what remains to be discovered in that region?
Science	Coasts, oceans, ecosystems, weather and human health all face impacts from climate change, and now valuable soils may also be affected.Climate change may reduce the ability of soils to absorb water in many parts of the world, according to a Rutgers-led study. And that could have serious implications for groundwater supplies, food production and security, stormwater runoff, biodiversity and ecosystems.The study is published in the journal Science Advances.Since rainfall patterns and other environmental conditions are shifting globally as a result of climate change, our results suggest that how water interacts with soil could change appreciably in many parts of the world, and do so fairly rapidly, said co-author Daniel Gimenez, a soil scientist and professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. We propose that the direction, magnitude and rate of the changes should be measured and incorporated into predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change.Water in soil is crucial for storing carbon, and soil changes could influence the level of carbon dioxide in the air in an unpredictable way, according to Gimenez, of the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. Carbon dioxide is one of the key greenhouse gases linked to climate change.
Soccer	What happened at Carrow Road on Saturday is one of the reasons we are all in love with football, even if fans of Manchester City might feel a little differently.By contrast, disbelieving Norwich supporters must pinch themselves to believe what they saw, as their team's 3-2 win marked the biggest sensation of the Premier League season. The newly promoted side were supposed to be complete no-hopers, with British bookmakers quoting them at 20-1 in a two-horse race. Their injury-ravaged team, with the worst defensive record in the division, could surely not compete with the champions' lethal attack, who were unbeaten in the league since losing at Newcastle in late January.
Soccer	"Nwankwo Kanu, Finidi George, Sunday Oliseh, and Tijani Babangida are four famous Nigerians who made their marks at Amsterdam ArenA, and Chidera Ejuke wants to do the same... but not for Ajax, for Heerenveen.While the four Super Eagles legends played for the home side, with Kanu and Finidi helping them to UEFA Champions League titles, 21-year-old Ejuke has little by way of credentials.He's not got a senior Nigeria cap, and came to the Eredivisie from Norwegian top flight side Valerenga, but is looking forward to the challenge of facing the Netherlands' most storied side on Saturday.In light of the recent form Ajax have been in, the youngster is confident he can both live his dream and stay motivated enough to make them remember his name.""I am always excited and motivated to play in every game but playing against Ajax, I get like an extra motivation and I want to play in games like that,"" he tells ESPN."
Soccer	Neymar's return to PSG on Saturday brought boos for much of the match, but by the 90th minute you could hear some cheers thanks to a bit of magic. Taking on Strasbourg and struggling to do much of anything, PSG won 1-0 thanks to a last-minute goal from, you guessed it, Neymar.The Brazilian scored a ridiculous bicycle kick off a cross to seal the win and possibly win back some of the hearts from an upset fan base
Soccer	Two contenders for MLS Cup meet on Saturday night as the Philadelphia Union host Los Angeles FC in a regular season battle. LAFC is the top team in the Western Conference and the strong favorite to represent the conference in MLS Cup 2019 in November, while the Union have found consistency in an open Eastern Conference, showing they belong in the title race conversation following a recent win over Atlanta United. Union: The Union are in second place in the Eastern Conference with a 15-6-8 record and have been goal-scoring machines. No team in the conference has more than Philly's 54.

Soccer	Real Madrid clung on to record a nervy but vital 3-2 win at home to Levante in La Liga on Saturday following a shoddy second-half performance after taking a three-goal lead with a Karim Benzema double and Casemiro strike.Benzema headed Real in front after 25 minutes when he met a cross from Dani Carvajal and the France forward struck again a few minutes later with a well-taken finish after latching on to a pass from James Rodriguez.Brazil midfielder Casemiro stretched Real's advantage right before half-time with a gut-busting run to meet a cross from compatriot Vinicius, but Levante hit back shortly after the interval through former Madrid forward Borja Mayoral.
Soccer	 Ansu Fati scored one and assisted on another as the 16-year-old's dream-like start to the season continued in Barcelona's 5-2 win over Valencia on Saturday. There were also two goals for Luis Suarez, who made his comeback from a calf injury in the second half at Camp Nou.Ansu needed less than two minutes to open the scoring on his full debut for Barca before setting up Frenkie de Jong to double the home side's lead just four minutes later.Kevin Gameiro pulled one back for Valencia before the break but Barca pulled clear in the second half. Gerard Pique scored the third from close range before two clever Suarez finishes ensured Ernesto Valverde's side moved within two points of early leaders Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga. Maxi Gomez added a stoppage-time consolation for Los Che.
Soccer	Barcelona s club president has confirmed that Lionel Messi would have the right to leave the club at the end of this season, as stipulated in his contract.Spanish newspaper El Pa s reported Thursday that Messi s current contract with Barcelona includes the option for the soccer great to unilaterally end his stay in the summer of 2020.Club president Josep Bartomeu said late Friday that  Leo Messi has a contract through 2020-21, but before that last season the player could leave Barca. Bartomeu, however, said he was confident that the club s all-time leading scorer would stay with the team  until 2021 and beyond. Messi, 32, has scored 603 goals in 687 matches for Barcelona since his debut in 2004. He has helped it win 34 titles, including four Champions League trophies and 10 Spanish leagues.The Argentine has repeatedly said he is happy to play for the Spanish champions.
Soccer	Chelsea star Tammy Abraham has become the owner of a bizarre new Premier League record after his sensational hat-trick performance against Wolves today.After over 20 years of Premier League football, there are still some impressive feats that have yet to be achieved.Chelsea forward Tammy Abraham set a new record today, by becoming the first player to score a hat-trick and an own goal in the same game.Abraham has been on fire for Chelsea recently, scoring 7 Premier League goals in his last three league outings. The youngster has the same number of league goals as Manchester City superstar Sergio Aguero.Abraham is one of several Chelsea youngsters that has massively benefitted since Frank Lampard s appointment as manager.The Blues legend is keen to give youth a chance and players like Abraham and Mason Mount are quickly becoming the west London club s most important players.
Soccer	Jurgen Klopp's side continued their unbeaten start to the 2019/20 season with a 3-1 win against Newcastle in the lunchtime kick-off. Despite falling behind to a Jetro Willems rocket in the seventh minute, the Reds completed a simple comeback. Sadio Mane curled in a stunner of his own inside half-an-hour before he tapped home a second following a big mistake from Toon goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Mohamed Salah rounded things off in the second half, scoring from close range. His finish was impressive, but Roberto Firminho's backheel assist was even better. Thanks to their latest result, Liverpool have now won 14 Premier League matches in a row and have become the first team in history to do so while scoring more than one goal in each game.
Soccer	Barcelona takes on Valencia on Saturday in La Liga play in what's will be a rematch of the 2019 Copa del Rey final from May. It could be the first game of the season for Lionel Messi, who missed the first three due to injury, though he remains doubtful. Valencia, meanwhile, inexplicably fired its cup-winning coach Marcelino Garcia Toral in favor of Albert Celades in a baffling move just months after lifting its first trophy in 11 years. Barcelona: With Messi likely to miss but Suarez potentially playing, Barca has the fire power in attack, especially with Antoine Griezmann. The lack of creativity in the first few matches has been concerning though, so expect Barca to play a bit more patient with Valencia still trying to learn the new system.Valencia: Celades supposedly likes to play a 4-3-3 though he didn't talk much about his system when he was announced as the coach this week. If he goes play with three up top, it will be interesting to see if he'll opt for big summer signing Maxi Gomez, who has yet to start.
Soccer	Manchester United earned its first win in over a month in beating Leicester 1-0 thanks to an early Marcus Rashford penalty on Saturday.United lost one and drew two of its last three English Premier League games since beating Chelsea 4-0 on the opening day, but seized the lead early against Leicester.
Soccer	"""This could be the team I need,"" Romelu Lukaku said. Sitting in a conference room in Porta Nuova, Milan's emerging business district, he was making the case that Football Club Internazionale Milano was the ideal setting for the resurrection of his career. ""There's the love I have for this area,"" he said. ""The love that I have for Inter. And it was the perfect moment for me to leave England. I didn't want to be there anymore.""It's not exactly coincidental that the club is counting on Lukaku, who spent the past two seasons struggling at Manchester United, to inspire its own revival. These are hard times for Inter, which won a Champions League trophy in 2010 to cap a five-year run of Serie A titles in 2010, but hasn't finished higher than fourth since then. Worse than that, despite a steadfast fan base that continues to nearly fill San Siro, one of Europe's largest stadiums, week after week, Inter has faded into international irrelevance. By winning each of the past eight scudetti and signing Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus is the Italian team that matters at the moment."

General Tech (Various buzzwords)	"Electrochemical devices that use sunlight to generate fuel represent a promising means of harvesting sustainable energy; but currently, none are efficient enough for real-world applications. One of the main reasons for the slow development is the difficulty in observing and measuring what is happening at the liquid-catalyst interface—the location in the cell where the fuel-producing chemical reactions are taking place—without interfering with the processes.Hoping to break this barrier, scientists at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a Department of Energy Innovation Hub based partly at Berkeley Lab, have invented a cell that is specially designed to allow for unobtrusive observation of an isolated, operating catalyst. A description of the cell is published in Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics.""Our design can mimic how a catalyst behaves in a full device, thanks to a fast-flow design that constantly replenishes the liquid at the interface,"" said lead author Walter Drisdell, a Berkeley Lab chemist. ""And the cell shape allows X-ray beams to graze over the surface, showing us the chemistry at the interface specifically.""The cell is expected to help scientists engineer and test new catalyst materials, which can be used in next-generation solar fuel devices that split water to produce hydrogen gas and convert carbon dioxide emissions into fuels like ethanol.""We intend to make the cell available to users at the DOE's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) facility so the entire science community can benefit from it,"" said Drisdell. SSRL is a DOE Office of Science user facility."
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	Two years ago, one freezing December night on a California rooftop, a tiny light shone weakly with a little help from the freezing night air. It wasn't a very bright glow. But it was enough to demonstrate the possibility of generating renewable power after the Sun goes down.Working with Stanford University engineers Wei Li and Shanhui Fan, University of California Los Angeles materials scientist Aaswath Raman put together a device that produces a voltage by channelling the day's residual warmth into cooling air.Our work highlights the many remaining opportunities for energy by taking advantage of the cold of outer space as a renewable energy resource, says Raman. We think this forms the basis of a complementary technology to solar. While the power output will always be substantially lower, it can operate at hours when solar cells cannot.
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	"Technology and AI are increasingly being used to improve our lives, especially in the medical field. Sometimes it's even better than the doctors themselves.Now, researchers at the University of Oxford have used machine learning to help estimate the health of arteries and have developed a new biomarker to predict heart disease, and prevent future heart attacks. The researchers claim it can identify people at risk five years before it strikes. The typical procedure for those with chest pain is to conduct CCTA or coronary CT angiogram — an imaging test to check the arteries. ""If there is no significant narrowing of the artery, which accounts for about 75 per cent of scans, people are sent home, yet some of them will still have a heart attack at some point in the future,"" the press release claims."
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	The topic of facial recognition has stirred up quite a lot of controversy in recent years. There are growing concerns, particularly over data privacy and data protection, especially now that such technology is so prevalent. Some people use facial recognition daily to unlock phones or authorise payments, and many encounter it in security at workplaces or airports.However, people have started to question the ethics as well as the accuracy and potential bias of facial recognition technology. In a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it was found that the technology can be gender- and/or race-biased, probably due to imbalances in the training data used. In another study last year, 28 US Congress members were mistakenly identified as criminals. Some cities in the US have even started to ban the use of the technology, including by the police. British MPs believe legislation should be put in place before facial recognition trials start, while the European Union is seeking regulations to limit what it calls the “indiscriminate” use of facial recognition.These events are not surprising for any new technology with such a wide potential impact on our lives. Careful attention and scrutiny should be paid to the accuracy of the technology, as well as to informed consent, legal liabilities and ethical use. These are all healthy steps towards ensuring legitimate use while respecting the rights of individuals.But artificial intelligence and deep-learning technology need not be privacy invasion tools.The AI technology behind facial recognition has much wider uses. It can be used not only to identify a person, but also to detect the presence of a face and its features, as well as to predict health, emotions and mental states. Depending on the application and what algorithms are used, the data privacy implications may be different.Recognising faces is also only one of the many important features deep learning technology has to offer. The most interesting is probably facial analytics, which analyse photos or videos to extract facial characteristics and predict gender, age and even body mass index. It has been used to detect early signs of diabetes, heart disease or dementia, and in measuring heart rates and blood pressure.

General Tech (Various buzzwords), Company	A team from AI pharma startup Insilico Medicine, working with researchers at the University of Toronto, took 21 days to create 30,000 designs for molecules that target a protein linked with fibrosis (tissue scarring). They synthesized six of these molecules in the lab and then tested two in cells; the most promising one was tested in mice. The researchers concluded it was potent against the protein and showed “drug-like” qualities. All in all, the process took just 46 days. The research was published in Nature Biotechnology this week.The system examines previous research and patents for molecules known to work against the drug target, prioritizing new structures that could be synthesized in the lab. It’s similar to what a human chemist might do to seek new therapies—just much faster.Although the research looks promising, it’s still very much a proof of concept. We’re a long way from AI-designed drugs being created, let alone sold to patients.
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	Prosthetic limbs are getting better every year, but the strength and precision they gain doesn’t always translate to easier or more effective use, as amputees have only a basic level of control over them. One promising avenue being investigated by Swiss researchers is having an AI take over where manual control leaves off.To visualize the problem, imagine a person with their arm amputated above the elbow controlling a smart prosthetic limb. With sensors placed on their remaining muscles and other signals, they may fairly easily be able to lift their arm and direct it to a position where they can grab an object on a table.But what happens next? The many muscles and tendons that would have controlled the fingers are gone, and with them the ability to sense exactly how the user wants to flex or extend their artificial digits. If all the user can do is signal a generic “grip” or “release,” that loses a huge amount of what a hand is actually good for.Here’s where researchers from Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL)  take over. Being limited to telling the hand to grip or release isn’t a problem if the hand knows what to do next — sort of like how our natural hands “automatically” find the best grip for an object without our needing to think about it. Robotics researchers have been working on automatic detection of grip methods for a long time, and it’s a perfect match for this situation.Prosthesis users train a machine learning model by having it observe their muscle signals while attempting various motions and grips as best they can without the actual hand to do it with. With that basic information the robotic hand knows what type of grasp it should be attempting, and by monitoring and maximizing the area of contact with the target object, the hand improvises the best grip for it in real time. It also provides drop resistance, being able to adjust its grip in less than half a second should it start to slip.The result is that the object is grasped strongly but gently for as long as the user continues gripping it with, essentially, their will. When they’re done with the object, having taken a sip of coffee or moved a piece of fruit from a bowl to a plate, they “release” the object and the system senses this change in their muscles’ signals and does the same.
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	As biotechnology becomes more central to new innovations in healthcare, material science and manufacturing, one of the nation’s research hubs is getting a new accelerator called Petri to launch companies focused on the commercialization of new technologies.Backed by the Boston-based venture capital firm Pillar, Petri has a three-year 15-million-dollar commitment to back companies developing new biotech applications in food, healthcare, industrial chemicals and new materials — along with the enabling technologies to bring these products to market.We are at the inflection point where these technologies will impact and continue to impact health but will also impact food, agriculture, chemicals and materials, says Petri co-founder, Tony Kulesa. Everything we touch has some element of biology.Pillar has already invested in a couple of companies that show the potential promise of new biotech research coming from Boston-based universities, like Boston University, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Asimov,io, a company that has set an ultimate goal of designing new genomes for industrial applications, was co-founded by graduates from Boston University and MIT, and is a part of the Pillar portfolio. Path Ai, a company working on enabling technologies for computational biology, also counts an MIT grad as a co-founder. Meanwhile, Harvard’s George Church has been instrumental in the development of a number of biotech companies working at the frontier of genetic applications for healthcare and manufacturing.As an instructor at MIT, Kulesa spent seven years at MIT watching, in his words, how engineering has transformed biology. “It became clear to me that these technologies need to get out in the world,” he said.Joining Kulesa as a managing director is Brian Baynes, a serial entrepreneur who founded Midori Health, an animal nutrition startup; Kaleido Biosciences, a microbiome control focused company; Celexion, a protein engineering and synthetic biology company; and Codon Devices, a synthetic biology toolkit company which was sold to Ginkgo Bioworks.
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	The federal Liberal government has spent billions of dollars over the past four years — and promised billions more — to get people and goods moving faster. Has it worked? The Financial Post spoke with experts from industry, academia and government over the past six months about the costs of congestion and how to mitigate its burden on individuals and businesses. In the finale of this three-part series, we focus on the role technology could play.Automation optimists envision a commuter utopia where urbanites whip around in shared, electric-powered, driver-less pods that travel close together in sync with self-driving taxis and minibuses, all connected to smart city infrastructure, potentially eliminating millions of private cars that are parked about 95 per cent of the time anyway.Such a shift to automated vehicles could reduce congestion costs in Toronto by 2.7 billion dollars, according to a 2015 report by the University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute that was commissioned by the city. The key is improving the communication between vehicles and infrastructure, thereby reducing bottlenecks, eliminating most traffic accidents and better adapting signals to account for weather or construction.Optimism levels vary, of course, and disagreements abound over what automated transportation systems will look like, how long the technology will take to deploy at a mass scale, it will likely take 20 years to introduce fully automated vehicles that make it okay for drivers to literally sleep at the wheel, and whether automation will even mitigate congestion in the end.
General Tech (Various buzzwords)	McDonald’s Corp. is making a bet it can automate the task of taking drive-thru orders.The world’s biggest restaurant company is buying startup Apprente Inc., a developer of voice-recognition technology for use in the restaurant industry, to help speed up lines. The idea is to eventually have a machine, instead of a person, on the other side of the intercom to relay orders to kitchen staff. In Chicago-area restaurants where the system is already being tested, employees still oversee drive-thru order-taking and can step in when needed.The acquisition is McDonald’s third tech deal in the past six months, and fits into the company’s push to lean more heavily on machines and artificial intelligence to boost sales. McDonald’s is also using Apprente’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, also home to Google owner Alphabet Inc., to start a tech lab, with plans to add employees there.

US National	Although he took pains to avoid on-camera interviews and press briefings during his 23-month tenure as Defense Secretary, James Mattis has embraced the media circuit rounds to promote his new book Call Sign Chaos.The book details lessons learned from more than 40 years in the Marines before his retirement in 2013, but says surprisingly little about his tumultuous time in the Trump Administration as Pentagon chief. Though the book does contain Mattis’ candid resignation letter criticizing the President’s treatment of allies and warming relations with China and Russia, the dearth of information on his time in the Administration has drawn fire from critics who say Mattis has a duty to let American voters know about his experiences and opinions. During an hour-long sit-down interview with TIME, Mattis said he has a “duty” to keep such internal matters on a sitting President to himself.However, in the book, Mattis does criticize decisions made by the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations and their implications on the battlefields where he commanded. From August 2010 until March 2014, his final years in uniform, Mattis headed U.S. Central Command and oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as other military operations in the Middle East. Unmarried all his life, Mattis, 69, was known as a scholarly general who preferred being close to front-line combat, earning him the nicknames “Mad Dog” and “Warrior Monk.”

US National	John Bolton ― who was notoriously hawkish with his strategy on Iran, North Korea and Syria ― will leave his position as White House national security adviser.“I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,” President Donald Trump announced Tuesday in a pair of tweets. “I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.”Bolton has continually supported and defended the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Critics have long panned his aggressive foreign policy approach and eagerness for war, both of which frequently clashed with Trump’s own approach to military intervention.“I thank John very much for his service,” Trump said, noting that he plans to name Bolton’s replacement next week. Charlie Kupperman, who was deputy national security adviser under Bolton, will fill in as the acting adviser. In a tweet of his own, Bolton said he had offered to resign Monday evening but Trump responded, “Let’s talk about it tomorrow.”White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham took issue with Bolton’s apparent suggestion that he left voluntarily, claiming in a text to The Daily Beast that Trump had in fact demanded Bolton’s resignation.
US National, International	A Defense Department agency is delaying a new long-term contract with the airport near Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland amid investigations into military personnel lodging at the luxury club, The Scotsman reports.A new multimillion-dollar refueling contract between Glasgow Prestwick Airport and the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency was supposed to go into effect in October and extend to September 2024, The Scotsman had reported earlier. But the contract has been “kicked in the long grass,” a source told the newspaper. The new agreement is on hold until at least December, The Scotsman reported.The delay follows Politico’s latest report that at least 60 members of the U.S. military have stayed at Trump’s Scottish resort on at least four different occasions since last year during refueling layovers at the nearby airport. The DLA told The Scotsman that the delay had nothing to do with the controversy and attributed the hold-up in documentation to an “extensive pre-award process.”The airport will continue to provide refueling services to the U.S. Air Force, likely under the terms of the current contract, The Scotsman noted.Both the Air Force and House Oversight Committee have launched investigations into the Prestwick refueling contract and military lodging at Trump’s resort. A letter in June from Oversight Committee leaders called for documentation from the Defense Department about the arrangement, noting that it benefited both the airport and Trump’s resort, which had been struggling financially. “Given the president’s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses,” the arrangement raises “serious conflict of interest concerns,” the letter noted.The New York Times reported Monday that Prestwick reached an agreement with Trump and the Trump Organization in 2014 to steer travelers to Trump’s resort. The following year, the U.S. Air Force arranged for Prestwick to book lodging in area hotels for aircrews on refueling layovers at the airport, according to the Times. A Prestwick spokesman told The Scotsman last week that the airport arranged hundreds of nights of lodging for American aircrews at Turnberry and other hotels in the area since 2017. It said a “small percentage” of the bookings were for Trump’s resort.
US National	"Top 2020 Democratic contenders Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, and Julian Castro announced on Sunday that Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh ""must be impeached,"" after a new, uncorroborated and disputed allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh surfaced in a weekend New York Times piece.The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court comes as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, ""saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.""The Times did not mention Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney, or Stier's legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a ""respected thought leader."""

US National	"President Donald Trump called on his Justice Department Sunday to ""rescue"" Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after The New York Times published an excerpt of a new book detailing sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that he has previously denied.The excerpt from ""The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,"" written by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, revisits an allegation raised during the Supreme Court justice's confirmation process in 2018. That allegation from Deborah Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a party when he was a freshman at Yale, according to an account published in The New Yorker. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegation.The book revisits Ramirez's claim and contains a former male classmate's new allegation which the authors say was corroborated by two sources. The authors reported the former classmate came forward to the FBI and senators concerning an incident he witnessed and said the FBI did not investigate the incident. CNN is not reporting any details related to the allegation because CNN has not independently verified it.Trump tweeted Sunday that Kavanaugh ""should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue."" (The President initially misspelled the word ""libel"" before deleting the tweet and correcting the word in a subsequent tweet.)In nominating Kavanaugh, Trump seized a rare opportunity to solidify a conservative majority for a generation on the Supreme Court. The President and those who worked to get him on the bench are now waiting to see if their calculation was correct, and for a sense of how far and how fast the conservative majority will move.The Supreme Court has not returned CNN's request for comment Sunday regarding Kavanaugh.The President's pick for the Supreme Court faced allegations of sexual misconduct that threatened to derail his confirmation in 2018."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blames Iran.President Donald Trump on Saturday offered U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s self-defense in a phone call hours after drone strikes left swaths of Saudi oil fields aflame and disrupted global energy production. Two sites, including the world’s largest oil processing facility and a massive Saudi oil field, were hit by explosives, leaving a smoke trail reportedly visible from space. Trump, the White House confirmed, told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman that the U.S. “strongly condemns today’s attack on critical energy infrastructure.”
US National	Some Democratic presidential contenders and former U.S. attorneys have raised concerns the investigation during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings was incomplete.Multiple Democratic presidential contenders and former U.S. attorneys are calling for a new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh and the past FBI probe into his behavior as another accusation of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court associate justice surfaced Saturday.Classmate Max Stier told two New York Times reporters that he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a drunken Yale University party where friends pushed Kavanaugh’s penis into the hands of a female student. The report was similar to an allegation lodged against Kavanaugh last year by former classmate Deborah Ramirez. Stier informed senators and the FBI of the incident during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, but it was never investigated, according to the Times.At the time, Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party, and she testified before senators at the hearings.
US National	Three years ago, in an attempt to prove he wasn’t racist, Donald Trump infamously pointed to a man in the audience of his presidential campaign rally and declared him “my African American.”Now, more than 2 1/2 years into Trump’s presidency, that man, Gregory Cheadle is abandoning the Republican Party to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020.Cheadle, 62, announced his decision to run as an independent in an interview with “PBS NewsHour” published Thursday. After 18 years in the party, he told the news program, he believes Republicans are using Black men like him as “political pawns” in their “pro-white” agenda.“President Trump is a rich guy who is mired in white privilege to the extreme,” Cheadle told PBS on Thursday. “Republicans are too sheepish to call him out on anything and they are afraid of losing their positions and losing any power themselves.”
US National	Cheadle didn’t say where he’ll run, but Federal Election Commission records show he’s run four times before in California’s 1st Congressional District.Trump’s blatant displays of racism have been a cornerstone of his presidency and campaign.In less than three years, Trump has suggested that a deadly white supremacist rally had “some very fine people on both sides,” inspired violence by continuing to slur immigrants as criminals and rapists, and launched a travel ban targeting Muslims.He also singled out four Democratic lawmakers, all of whom were women of color, in a feud earlier this year, urging them to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.”
US National	Cheadle said Trump crossed the line for him when the president attacked the city of Baltimore and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) earlier this summer.In late July, Trump blasted Cummings as a “racist” and described Baltimore as a “rodent-infested mess” of a district where “no human being would want to live.”Cheadle, who is from Redding, California, told PBS that he had enough of the Republican Party when he saw his friends defend Trump’s remarks on Baltimore.“They were sidestepping the people of color issue and saying that, ‘No, it’s not racist,’” he said. “They were saying these people were socialists and communists. That’s what they were saying. And I thought this is a classic case of whites not seeing racism because they want to put blinders on and make it about something else.”Trump faced backlash during his 2016 campaign when he pointed to Cheadle as “my African American,” though at the time, Cheadle said he wasn’t offended.
US National	"President Donald Trump explains he wasn't seeing eye-to-eye with ousted hawkish national security adviser John Bolton. The sudden shake-up comes as the president faces pressing decisions on difficult foreign policy issues.John Bolton wasted no time getting back in the political game Friday, just a few days after being ousted as President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser.Bolton has resumed his old job as the head of two political action committees, the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC, announcing that he would be donating $10,000 to five Republican incumbent re-election campaigns for 2020.These include Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.).The website reads, ""The John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC seek a strong, clear, and dependable US national security policy, resting on constancy and resolve.”“The experience that these incumbent members of Congress have provides them with a remarkable understanding and knowledge of the threats we face from international terrorism and rogue regimes such as Iran and North Korea,” the statement continues.Trump fired Bolton, his third national security adviser, on Tuesday, saying the two “disagreed strongly” on foreign policy matters. Bolton, however, contradicted Trump's characterization of his departure, writing in a tweet minutes after the president's that he offered to resign.Bolton had temporarily suspended his political activity during his time at the White House."
US National	The polls du jour show President Donald Trump trailing basically every Democrat in the 2020 general election, both nationally and in individual states — even in Texas.Democratic voters might rejoice at these signs that Trump will be a one-term president. But they should temper themselves: Hillary Clinton was regularly leading Trump by 10 points or more a year ahead of the 2016 election. Polls taken 14 months before an election are simply not predictive. Too much can happen and sentiments can change when the race becomes one specific Democrat running against one specific Republican.We also shouldn’t read too much, pollsters and political handicappers say, into the variations in how different Democrats fare against Trump in these polls. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders might enjoy the biggest margins simply because they have the highest name ID among the 2020 Democratic field. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they would wallop Trump whereas Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg would struggle. It might just mean fewer Americans have heard of them.But we can still learn something from these surveys. Their message is pretty simple: Trump looks weak. The president is lagging in the low 40s in head-to-head polls, consistent with his stubbornly low approval ratings. A lot of Americans seem to be fully committed to or are actively considering voting for somebody else. That’s not where the incumbent, after three years in office, should be if they want a second term.
US National	The latest hypothetical 2020 general election polling you should know about.Even in Texas, long an electoral pipe dream for Democrats that is suddenly being taken more seriously as a possible target for the challengers, a new survey found Trump polling behind not only Joe Biden (who typically fares the best against Trump in hypothetical head-to-heads) but Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris too.These were the latest numbers in Texas from Latino Decisions, North Star Opinion Research, and the University of Houston.Joe Biden 47 percent, Donald Trump 43 percent.Bernie Sanders 48 percent, Donald Trump 42 percent.Elizabeth Warren 44 percent, Donald Trump 42 percent.Kamala Harris 45 percent, Donald Trump 44 percent.Cory Booker 43 percent, Donald Trump 41 percent.Julián Castro 44 percent, Donald Trump 41 percent.
